<sent_begin> in short , collective behavior is any group behavior that is not VERB or regulated by an institution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM primary forms of collective behavior : the NOUN , the mass , and the public . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it takes a fairly large number of people in close NOUN to form a NOUN ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples include a group of people VERB an PROPN PROPN NOUN , VERB at a PROPN NOUN , or VERB a NOUN service . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are those who come together for a ADJ event that occurs regularly , like a religious service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are people who join together to express emotion , often at NOUN , NOUN , or the like . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the final type , acting NOUN , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or NOUN . in addition to the different types of NOUN , collective groups can also be identified in NUM other ways . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologist david PROPN ( NUM ) VERB this question by developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want to change and how much change they want . <sent_end> <sent_begin> reform movements seek to change something specific about the social structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples include ADJ groups , NOUN against ADJ driving ( PROPN ) , the PROPN movement for immigration reform , and the human rights campaign ’s NOUN for marriage equality . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> resource PROPN and the civil rights PROPN example of resource NOUN theory is activity of the civil rights movement in the decade between the ADJ 1950s and the ADJ 1960s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social movements had existed before , ADV the women 's suffrage movement and a long line of labor movements , thus VERB an existing social movement NOUN , which is the multiple social movement industries in a society , even if they have widely varying constituents and goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the civil rights movement had also existed well before PROPN PROPN refused to give up her NOUN NOUN to a white man . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the anti - gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic NOUN with its ADJ NOUN that marriage is only between a man and a woman . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , the second type , offers a solution and states how it will be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some examples of this frame , when looking at the issue of marriage equality as VERB by the anti - gay marriage movement , include the plan to VERB marriage to “ NUM man / NUM woman ” or to allow only “ civil unions ” instead of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> new social movement theory , a development of european social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s , attempts to explain the NOUN of ADJ and ADJ movements that are difficult to VERB using traditional social movement theories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rather than being NUM specific theory , it is more of a perspective that VERB around understanding movements as they relate to politics , identity , culture , and social change . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN describes the processes that increase the amount of NOUN and NOUN of structure in societies resulting in the move from an ADJ society to a developed , ADV driven society ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by this definition , the level of NOUN within a society is VERB by the NOUN of its technology , particularly as it VERB to NOUN , industry , and the like . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists study all aspects and levels of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists working from the ADJ - level study small groups and individual interactions , while those using ADJ - level analysis look at NOUN among and between large groups and societies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a ADJ - level study might look at the accepted rules of NOUN in various groups such as among NOUN or business NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> remember , though , that culture is a product of the people in a society ; sociologists take care not to treat the concept of “ culture ” as though it were ADJ in its own right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is an error of VERB an ADJ concept as though it has a real , material existence ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in seeking PROPN , outside NOUN of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an NOUN ’s point of view . in his book the nature of social action ( NUM ) , PROPN described sociology as VERB to " VERB the meaning of social action and ADV give a ADJ explanation of the way in which action VERB and the effects it produces . " <sent_end> <sent_begin> he and other like - ADJ sociologists proposed a philosophy of NOUN ADV social researchers would VERB for NOUN as they worked to represent social processes , cultural norms , and societal values . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this approach led to some research methods whose NOUN was not to VERB or predict ( traditional in science ) , but to ADV gain an in - depth understanding of social NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists study social events , interactions , and patterns , and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in sociology , a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a ADJ NOUN , called a hypothesis , about society ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ sociological theories are still considered important and current , but new sociological theories build upon the work of their NOUN and add to them ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in sociology , a few theories provide broad NOUN that help explain many different aspects of social life , and these are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are ADJ and ADJ NOUN used within a discipline to VERB theories , NOUN , and the experiments performed in support of them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM NOUN have come to VERB sociological thinking , because they provide useful NOUN : structural NOUN , conflict theory , and symbolic NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he believed that to study society , a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws , NOUN , values , religious beliefs , customs , NOUN , and NOUN , which all serve to govern social life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN - brown ( NUM – NUM ) defined the function of any ADJ activity as the part it VERB in social life as a whole , and therefore the NOUN it makes to social stability and NOUN ( PROPN - brown NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called ADJ equilibrium by later sociologists such as PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another noted structural NOUN , robert PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , VERB out that social processes often have many functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ functions are the consequences of a social process that are sought or VERB , while ADJ functions are the ADJ consequences of a social process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ function of college education , for example , includes VERB knowledge , VERB for a NOUN , and finding a good job that VERB that education . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conflict theory has been VERB because it tends to focus on conflict to the NOUN of VERB stability . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually VERB over time rather than changing ADV as conflict theory would suggest . <sent_end> <sent_begin> symbolic PROPN theory <sent_end> <sent_begin> symbolic NOUN is a ADJ - level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> communication — the exchange of meaning through language and NOUN — is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociological research attempts to answer a vast variety of questions , such as these and more , about our social world . we often have NOUN about social situations , but these may be VERB by our expectations or based on limited data . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , scientific research is based on ADJ evidence , which is evidence that comes from direct experience , ADV VERB data , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full NOUN , but research does n’t support this opinion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a hypothesis is a ADJ ADJ NOUN about VERB outcomes between NUM or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific NOUN in the social world and allows for NOUN to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists use ADJ data and the scientific method , or an ADJ framework , to increase understanding of societies and social interactions , but research begins with the search for an answer to a question . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists do not rule out any topic , but would VERB to frame these questions in better research terms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is why sociologists are ADJ to define their terms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a NOUN study , for instance , NOUN could be defined as “ personal NOUN to maintain physical appearance ( as opposed to health ) , ” and a researcher might VERB , “ how do VERB personal NOUN NOUN reflect the cultural value placed on appearance ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> when forming these basic research questions , sociologists develop an ADJ definition , that is , they define the concept in terms of the physical or ADJ steps it takes to ADV measure it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ definition VERB an ADJ condition of the concept . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how NUM form of human behavior VERB another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in research , independent variables are the cause of the change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the dependent variable is the effect , or NOUN that is changed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a researcher would n’t VERB into a crime - VERB NOUN at NOUN , VERB out , “ any NOUN members around ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> and if a researcher VERB into a NOUN NOUN and VERB the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency , the self - conscious , ADJ NOUN might not behave naturally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called the PROPN effect — where people change their behavior because they know they are being VERB as part of a study . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN effect is ADJ in some research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN can VERB NOUN for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors ( such as VERB , driving , or VERB NOUN ) or ADJ information such as employment status , income , and education levels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a survey VERB a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college NOUN , international students , or NOUN living with type NUM ( ADJ - NOUN ) NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most researchers choose to survey a small NOUN of the population , or a sample : that is , a ADJ number of subjects who represent a larger population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for some topics , the researcher might VERB INTJ - or - no or multiple - choice questions , allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this kind of ADJ data — research collected in ADJ form that can be counted — are easy to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just VERB up the number of “ INTJ ” and “ no ” responses or correct NOUN , and VERB them into NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can also VERB more complex questions with more complex NOUN — beyond “ INTJ , ” “ no , ” or the NOUN next to a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they meet subjects where they live , work , and play . <sent_end> <sent_begin> field research refers to VERB primary data from a natural environment without doing a NOUN experiment or a survey . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a research method VERB to an ADJ framework rather than to the scientific method . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involve ADJ observation of an entire community . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while sociologists often engage in original research studies , they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary data does n’t result from ADJ research collected from primary sources , but are the already completed work of other researchers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN is a great resource for students of sociology as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN VERB a code of NOUN — formal NOUN for conducting sociological research — consisting of principles and ADJ standards to be used in the discipline . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also describes NOUN for NOUN , VERB , and VERB NOUN of ADJ conduct . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in everyday NOUN , people ADV distinguish between the terms culture and society , but the terms have slightly different NOUN , and the distinction is important to a sociologist . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by “ community , ” sociologists refer to a ADJ region — as small as a NOUN ( PROPN , or “ the east side of town ” ) , as large as a country ( PROPN , the united states , or PROPN ) , or ADV in between ( in the united states , this might include someone who VERB with southern or ADJ society ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> europe ’s colonial expansion , begun in the ADJ century , was often VERB by a severe cultural NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> values often suggest how people should behave , but they do n’t ADV reflect how people do behave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> values VERB an ideal culture , the standards society would like to VERB and live up to . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but ideal culture VERB from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people VERB certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or NOUN , or by VERB formal actions of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage NOUN to cultural norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes people VERB to norms in NOUN or NOUN of positive sanctions : good NOUN , for instance , may mean NOUN from parents and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NOUN of formal norms , but the list of ADJ norms — ADJ behaviors that are generally and widely VERB to — is longer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people learn ADJ norms by observation , NOUN , and general socialization . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> humans , ADV and ADV , are always VERB to make sense of their surrounding world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN — such as NOUN , NOUN , objects , signals , and words — help people understand that world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they provide NOUN to understanding experiences by VERB ADJ NOUN that are shared by societies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in each pair , NUM type of NOUN is considered high - NOUN and the other low - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class NOUN of a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people often associate high culture with NOUN , political power , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists distinguish NOUN from NOUN , which are a type of NOUN that VERB some of the larger culture ’s norms and values . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast to NOUN , which operate relatively ADV within the larger society , NOUN might actively VERB larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by , sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts — when things are put together in an entirely new manner . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the late NOUN and early NUM , electric NOUN were VERB at an ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today , many u.s. companies set up NOUN in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a person in the united states VERB to get information about banking , insurance , or computer services , the person taking that call may be working in another country . ADP the process of globalization is diffusion , or the spread of material and ADJ culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while globalization refers to the integration of markets , diffusion VERB to a similar process in the integration of international cultures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> roughly NUM years ago , human societies began to recognize their ability to VERB and VERB animals and to grow and VERB their own plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ societies , such as the PROPN NOUN , rely on the NOUN of animals as a resource for survival . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike earlier NOUN - NOUN who VERB entirely on existing resources to VERB ADJ , ADJ groups were able to VERB NOUN for food , NOUN , and transportation , and they created a surplus of goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ century gave rise to ADJ societies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these societies VERB a strict ADJ system of power based around land ownership and protection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he VERB that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’s actions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> durkheim called the ADJ beliefs , NOUN , and attitudes of a society the collective NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in his NOUN to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ if i do not VERB to the NOUN of society , if in DET NOUN i do not VERB to the customs observed in DET country and in DET class , the NOUN i VERB , the social NOUN in which i AUX VERB , produce , although in an ADJ form , the same effects as punishment ” ( durkheim NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this type of thinking was common in ADJ societies where strong bonds of NOUN and a low division of labor created shared NOUN and values among people , such as NOUN - NOUN groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when people tend to do the same type of work , durkheim argued , they tend to think and act ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in industrial societies , mechanical NOUN is replaced with organic NOUN , which is social order based around an NOUN of economic and social differences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ societies , durkheim wrote , division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> marx ’s NOUN and NOUN , PROPN PROPN , wrote the condition of the working - class in england in NUM , which described in detail the ADJ conditions . such is the old town of PROPN , and on re - reading DET NOUN , i AUX forced to VERB that instead of being VERB , it is far from black enough to VERB a true NOUN of the NOUN , NOUN , and PROPN , the NOUN of all NOUN of NOUN , NOUN , and health which VERB the construction of this single district , containing at least NUM to NUM NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and such a district exists in the heart of the second city of england , the first NOUN city of the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> add to that the long hours , the use of child labor , and exposure to extreme conditions of heat , cold , and ADJ chemicals , and it is no NOUN that marx and PROPN referred to NOUN , which is a way of VERB an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products ( such as land , oil , NOUN , NOUN , X . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government , as the “ NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ” PROPN marx ( left ) and PROPN PROPN ( right ) VERB differences in social power between “ have ” and “ have - not ” groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order for society to VERB false consciousness , marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness , the awareness of NUM ’s NOUN in society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead of existing as a “ class in itself , ” the NOUN must become a “ class for itself ” in order to produce social change ( marx and PROPN NUM ) , meaning that instead of just being an ADJ NOUN of society , the class could become an NOUN for social NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM sociologists PROPN PROPN and thomas PROPN wrote a book called the social construction of reality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in it , they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction , which they call NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN describes how “ any action that is repeated frequently becomes VERB into a pattern , which can then be PUNCT performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same ADJ effort ” ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their ADJ construction of reality rather than by ADJ reality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NOUN who is ADV given a NOUN — NOUN , NOUN , NOUN — might live up to the term even though it initially was n’t a part of his NOUN . like PROPN and PROPN in their NOUN of NOUN , thomas states that our moral NOUN and social norms are created by “ ADJ NOUN of the situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ” this concept is defined by sociologist robert PROPN PROPN as a self - VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB that with a self - VERB NOUN , even a false idea can become true if it is VERB upon . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their NOUN and role in society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN are VERB — those you do not select , such as NOUN , elderly person , or female . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others , called achieved NOUN , are obtained by choice , such as a high school NOUN , self - made NOUN , or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or NOUN of roles , attached to it ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider the NOUN of a parent : NOUN , NOUN , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral NOUN — the list goes on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN ideas expand on the ideas of charles PROPN and the looking - glass self . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , we base our image on what we think other people see ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , NOUN , or natural NOUN , while NOUN - NOUN are those whose claim to NOUN status has not been VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADV VERB person , on the other hand , is neither a NOUN nor an NOUN - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN have VERB their homes while remaining inside their country ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> simultaneously , this ADJ VERB to an ADJ increase in natural resource use , like NOUN , which ADV increased pollution in the form of carbon NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the suburbs became more ADJ and lost their NOUN , those who could VERB it turned to the NOUN , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically VERB by even ADJ families who want more space and have the resources to VERB their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , the suburbs , NOUN , and ADJ areas all combine to form a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new york was the first u.s. NOUN , a huge urban NOUN VERB multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as cities VERB from NOUN - based industrial to NOUN and information - based ADJ societies , NOUN becomes more common . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs when members of the middle and upper classes enter and VERB city areas that have been ADV less ADJ while the poor urban NOUN are forced by resulting price pressures to leave those NOUN for increasingly ADJ portions of the city . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , NUM percent of the world ’s NUM NUM people ADV VERB in urban areas , with the most ADJ region being north america ( NUM percent ) , followed by latin america / the PROPN ( NUM percent ) , with europe coming in third ( NUM percent ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the challenge for a human NOUN working in u.s. urban NOUN is to design NOUN and NOUN with natural NOUN , while also VERB out how to provide for free - VERB transport of ADJ NOUN , not to VERB NOUN PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ zone model ( PROPN NUM ) is perhaps the most famous example of human NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this model views a city as a series of ADJ circular areas , expanding ADV from the center of the city , with various “ zones ” VERB adjacent zones ( as new categories of people and businesses ADP the NOUN of ADJ zones ) and VERB ( then after NOUN , the new NOUN VERB the areas they have VERB and push out the previous NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN is a united states agency for international development ( PROPN ) funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental NOUN of peripheral and semi - peripheral countries by VERB the use of alternative , low - carbon , energy sources with financial NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is organized around NUM NOUN : ( 1 ) climate change NOUN , ( 2 ) ADJ energy , and ( 3 ) ADJ NOUN ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> pollution <sent_end> <sent_begin> pollution describes what happens when NOUN are introduced into an environment ( water , air , land ) at levels that are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> environments can often VERB a limited amount of NOUN without marked change , and water , air , and soil can “ VERB ” themselves to a certain degree . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group NOUN ( VERB primarily by people of color and members of low ADJ groups ) are VERB with a ADJ number of NOUN , including ADJ waste NOUN , NOUN NOUN , and other sources of environmental pollution and ADJ NOUN that lower the quality of life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all around the NOUN , members of minority groups bear a greater burden of the health problems that result from higher exposure to waste and pollution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to explore these questions , we turn to NOUN , or the study of populations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most important components that affect the issues above are NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . the NOUN rate of a society is a measure VERB the number of children born . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN number is generally lower than the NOUN number , which measures the potential number of children that could be born to women of VERB age . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the population NOUN includes the sex ratio , the number of men for every NUM women , as well as the population NOUN , a picture of population distribution by sex and age ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this population NOUN shows the NOUN of the NUM u.s. population according to age and sex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( graph NOUN of PROPN PROPN NOUN and the u.s. PROPN bureau ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of course , some theories are less focused on the ADJ hypothesis that the world ’s population will meet a ADJ challenge to VERB itself . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ theory VERB at the idea of humans VERB themselves out ; it VERB that human NOUN can VERB any environmental or social issues that develop . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as an example , it points to the issue of food supply . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they learn to understand interactions involving different people with a variety of purposes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a child at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in a NOUN who together make for a smooth NOUN experience ( someone NOUN you , another takes your order , someone else VERB the food , while yet another VERB away ADJ NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , children develop , understand , and learn the idea of the ADJ other , the common behavioral expectations of general society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by this stage of development , an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by NUM or many others — and thus , from a sociological perspective , to have a “ self ” ( PROPN NUM ; PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s theory of moral development <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to this belief , our NOUN , interests , and NOUN are set before birth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from this perspective , then , who we are depends on nature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the process of NOUN , old behaviors that were ADJ in a previous role are removed because they are no longer of use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is necessary when a person moves to a senior care center , goes to NOUN school , or serves time in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> school and NOUN NOUN , led by NOUN serving as role models and leaders , regularly VERB what society VERB from children . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the ADJ NOUN , the ADJ NOUN done by schools . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is usually a NUM - time event , for instance , and VERB to a political party does n’t VERB interaction with others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a NOUN of people standing in line at PROPN — are considered an aggregate , or a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another example of a NOUN is people who share similar characteristics but are not VERB to NUM another in any way . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face - to - face in long - term emotional ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this group serves emotional needs : ADJ functions rather than ADJ ones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a reference group is a group that people compare themselves to — it provides a standard of measurement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in u.s. society , NOUN groups are common reference groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other secondary groups , like a workplace or a NOUN , also have formal leaders , but the NOUN and functions of leadership can vary significantly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an instrumental leader is NUM who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with VERB set tasks . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can imagine that an army general or a PROPN NUM NOUN would be an instrumental leader . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> despite the NOUN , PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of ADJ and instrumental leadership . in addition to these leadership functions , there are NUM different leadership NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they work hard to build NOUN before VERB a course of action and moving forward . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> she would n’t want people to think she was too poor to find proper NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the extent to which an individual VERB with group norms or expectations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you might recall , we use reference groups to VERB and understand how to act , to VERB , and to behave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologist PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) VERB that formal organizations fall into NUM categories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the name suggests , VERB them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership VERB in an ADJ way . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a total institution is NUM in which NOUN or military soldiers live a controlled NOUN and in which total NOUN takes place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the third type is ADJ organizations , which , as the name suggests , are VERB because of the need for a specific material NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high school and the workplace fall into this category — NUM VERB in NOUN of a NOUN , the other in order to make money . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are VERB , written down , and VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , at your college or university , the student NOUN are VERB within the student PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while ADV based on NOUN , NOUN can VERB the existing balance of power by only VERB the NOUN in traditionally male and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the PROPN rule of PROPN , ADV an entire organization is ruled by a few NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> do you think this is true ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an adult VERB ADV is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a NOUN of VERB in society and are likely to continue to VERB to norms in the future . sometimes , in more extreme cases , primary deviance can VERB into secondary deviance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary deviance occurs when a person ’s self - concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as ADJ by members of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the person may begin to take on and VERB the role of a “ ADJ ” as an act of NOUN against the society that has labeled that individual as such . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although deviance is a NOUN of social norms , it ’s not always ADJ , and it ’s not necessarily bad . <sent_end> <sent_begin> crime , on the other hand , is a behavior that VERB official law and is ADJ through formal sanctions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB to class ADJ is a ADJ behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ NOUN fall under this category . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ crimes involve the NOUN or NOUN of property but do not use force or the threat of force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of this , they are also sometimes called “ property crimes . ” NOUN , car NOUN , and NOUN are all types of ADJ crimes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although these types of NOUN ADV receive the same amount of media coverage as street crimes , they can be far more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> financial NOUN such as insurance NOUN , PROPN NOUN , and ADJ practices by banks can VERB families who lose their savings or home . an often - VERB third type of crime is ADJ crime . <sent_end> <sent_begin> crimes are called ADJ when the NOUN is not ADV VERB another person . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the term NOUN of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ ADJ ” behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a related process is NOUN , in which “ ADJ ” behavior is VERB again . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN affect who VERB to the patient , how people respond to the patient , and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> VERB cultural expectations is not , in and of itself , a ADJ means of VERB the presence of a psychological disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since behavior varies from NUM culture to another , what may be expected and considered appropriate in NUM culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , VERB a NOUN ’s NOUN is expected in the united states because a ADJ social NOUN VERB that we VERB ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how do mental health NOUN VERB whether or not a person ’s inner states and behaviors ADV represent a psychological disorder ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB at a proper NOUN — that is , ADV VERB and VERB a set of defined symptoms — is ADV crucial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process enables NOUN to use a common language with others in the field and NOUN in communication about the disorder with the patient , NOUN and the public . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second NOUN system , the international PROPN of diseases ( PROPN ) , is also widely recognized . <sent_end> <sent_begin> published by the world health organization ( who ) , the PROPN was developed in europe ADV after world war ii and , like the PROPN , has been VERB several times . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this NOUN , people who are high on ADJ tend to be independent NOUN , cold , NOUN , ADJ , ADJ , and hostile , whereas people who are high on NOUN control tend to have high NOUN control — they are more ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ ( PROPN , PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while PROPN ’s NUM factors may be too broad , the PROPN ’s NUM - factor system has been VERB for being too ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another personality theory , called the five factor model , effectively VERB a middle ground , with its NUM factors referred to as the big NUM personality traits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is the most popular theory in personality psychology today and the most accurate NOUN of the basic trait NOUN ( NOUN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM explanation for the ADJ differences is ADJ NOUN ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is the concept that people choose to move to places that are ADJ with their NOUN and needs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN PROPN test was developed in NUM by a ADJ psychologist named PROPN PROPN ( ADJ “ NOUN - NOUN ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a series of ADJ NOUN NOUN that are presented to a NOUN by a psychologist . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to address this need , robert PROPN developed the first ADV specific ADJ test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of african americans ( PROPN - PROPN & PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the VERB version of the NOUN is the PROPN - PROPN VERB blacks test ( c - PROPN ) ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the c - PROPN contains NUM color images that show NOUN of african - american NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is ADV the situation that charles PROPN describes in the theory of evolution by natural selection ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in simple terms , the theory states that organisms that are better VERB for their environment will survive and reproduce , while those that are ADV VERB for their environment will die off . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during the egg 's NOUN from the NOUN through the ADJ tubes , to the NOUN , a sperm may VERB an egg . the egg and the sperm each contain NUM chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chromosomes are long NOUN of genetic material known as NOUN acid ( dna ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dna is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , each parent VERB half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual . <sent_end> <sent_begin> phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( dna ) inherited from one ’s parents . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so far , we have discussed traits that involve just NUM gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most traits are ADJ : controlled by more than NUM gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> height is NUM example of a ADJ trait , as are skin color and weight . in this PROPN NOUN , n represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is NUM way to describe this interaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> range of reaction VERB that our genes set the NOUN within which we can operate , and our environment VERB with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if an individual ’s genetic makeup VERB her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is VERB in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , identical NOUN share the same genetic information ( identical NOUN develop from a single VERB egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , ADJ NOUN develop from NUM different eggs VERB by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non - ADJ NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but even with identical genes , there remains an ADJ amount of NOUN in how gene expression can VERB over the course of each NOUN ’s life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a study of people who were given up for NOUN , NOUN whose biological NOUN had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a ADJ family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another ADJ disorder than were any of the other groups in the study : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ cells provide NOUN on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow ADJ communication , provide NOUN to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and VERB immune responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> neurons , on the other hand , serve as ADJ information NOUN that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this section ADV describes the structure and function of neurons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleus of the neuron is located in the NOUN , or cell body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN has VERB NOUN known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these signals are transmitted ADV across the PROPN and down a major extension from the PROPN known as the axon , which ends at multiple ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN contain ADJ vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical NOUN of the nervous system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once neurotransmitters are released into the NOUN , they travel across the small space and bind with VERB receptors on the NOUN of an adjacent neuron . <sent_end> <sent_begin> receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters VERB , vary in shape , with different shapes “ VERB ” different neurotransmitters . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of NOUN , called the VERB potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like a NOUN NOUN VERB out and VERB to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ADJ to VERB across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane VERB its NOUN ( i.e. , a sodium - NOUN NOUN that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this positive NOUN VERB the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell NOUN to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of NOUN and VERB a new NOUN of sodium ions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the neurotransmitters travel across the NOUN and bind to receptors on the NOUN of the adjacent neuron , and the process VERB itself in the new neuron ( VERB the signal is ADV strong to VERB an action potential ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the NOUN VERB away , are broken down into ADJ fragments , or are VERB in a process known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves the neurotransmitter being VERB back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this perspective , ADJ NOUN can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are drugs that treat ADJ symptoms by VERB neurotransmitter balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is involved in muscle action and memory ; it can increase arousal and VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nervous system can be divided into NUM major NOUN : the central nervous system ( PROPN ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PROPN ) , shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is VERB of the brain and spinal cord ; the PROPN VERB the PROPN to the rest of the body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it can be further VERB into the sympathetic and ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sympathetic nervous system is involved in VERB the body for stress - related activities ; the ADJ nervous system is associated with VERB the body to NOUN , day - to - day NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM systems have complementary functions , operating in NOUN to maintain the body ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , think about how you feel when you have to VERB up and give a NOUN in front of a NOUN of people , or right before taking a big test . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you are in no real physical danger in those situations , and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world ; in fact , we VERB negative health consequences when faced ADV with psychological NOUN that we can neither fight nor VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN and NOUN form important NOUN that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most prominent NOUN , known as the ADJ NOUN , is the deep NOUN that VERB the brain into NUM NOUN or NOUN : the left NOUN and the right NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN NUM NOUN of the ADJ cortex are part of the NOUN ( [ link ] ) , which is the largest part of the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN contains the ADJ cortex and a number of other structures that VERB ADP the cortex ( called ADJ structures ) : thalamus , hypothalamus , pituitary gland , and the ADJ system ( collection of structures ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on september NUM , NUM , NOUN ( age NUM ) was working as a NOUN NOUN in PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the brain ’s ADJ lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains the ADJ cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as NOUN , temperature , and pain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ cortex is organized ADV , which means that ADJ relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the ADJ cortex ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s area , important for speech NOUN , is also located here . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whereas individuals with damage to PROPN ’s area have difficulty producing language , those with damage to PROPN ’s area can produce ADJ language , but they are unable to understand it ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other areas of the PROPN areas of the NOUN , located ADP the ADJ cortex , include the thalamus and the ADJ system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the thalamus is a sensory NOUN for the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of our senses , with the exception of NOUN , are VERB through the thalamus before being VERB to other areas of the brain for processing ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is an essential structure for learning and memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is involved in our experience of emotion and in VERB emotional meaning to our memories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hypothalamus VERB a number of ADJ processes , including the regulation of body temperature , NOUN , and blood pressure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN PROPN NOUN is VERB of structures located deep within the brain , between the NOUN and the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ formation is VERB in the NOUN , but it actually extends up into the NOUN and down into the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains the medulla , PROPN , and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN ( latin for “ little brain ” ) receives NOUN from muscles , NOUN , joints , and structures in our ear to control balance , NOUN , movement , and motor skills . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) NOUN involves taking a number of x - rays of a particular section of a person ’s body or brain ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the x - rays pass through tissues of different NOUN at different rates , allowing a computer to VERB an overall image of the area of the body being VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> tissues of different NOUN give off different signals , which a computer VERB and VERB on a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> functional magnetic NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) VERB on the same principles , but it shows changes in brain activity over time by VERB blood flow and oxygen levels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN provides more detailed images of the brain ’s structure , as well as better NOUN in time , than is possible in ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> major PROPN pituitary gland VERB from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the pituitary is often referred to as the “ NOUN gland ” because its NOUN hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out NOUN from the hypothalamus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the adrenal glands VERB ADP our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as NOUN ( NOUN ) and NOUN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the pancreas is an internal organ that VERB hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADJ hormones are essential for VERB stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by VERB blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for NUM , each NOUN must sign an ADJ NOUN form before they can participate in the experiment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ NOUN form provides a written NOUN of what participants can expect during the experiment , including potential NOUN and NOUN of the research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also VERB participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be VERB without NOUN at any time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN in the PROPN PROPN study receives an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> correlation means that there is a relationship between NUM or more variables ( such as NOUN NOUN consumption and crime ) , but this relationship does not necessarily VERB cause and effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM variables are VERB , it simply means that as NUM variable changes , so does the other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> put another way , it means that as NUM variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when NUM variable decreases so does the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NUM variables are ADV VERB , a decrease in NUM variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> think back to our discussion of the research done by the american cancer society and how their research projects were some of the first NOUN of the link between NOUN and cancer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it seems ADJ to VERB that NOUN causes cancer , but if we were limited to ADJ research , we would be VERB our NOUN by making this assumption . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you VERB learned , the only way to establish that there is a cause - and - effect relationship between NUM variables is to conduct a scientific experiment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we also need to ADV define , or VERB , what is considered violent and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ definition is a NOUN of how we will measure our variables , and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in VERB violent behavior , we might choose to VERB only physical acts like VERB or NOUN as instances of this behavior , or we also may choose to include ADJ ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a double - ADJ study , both the researchers and the participants are ADJ to group NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why would a researcher want to run a study where no one VERB who is in which group ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in our example of how violent television programs affect children ’s display of violent behavior , the independent variable is the type of program — violent or ADJ — viewed by participants in the study ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in our example , the dependent variable is the number of violent acts VERB by the experimental participants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now that we have a sample , the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with random NOUN , all participants have an equal chance of being VERB to either group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is statistical NOUN that will ADV VERB each of the fourth NOUN in the sample to either the experimental or the control group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the american psychological association ( apa ) VERB a ADJ VERB how to write a paper for NOUN to scientific NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike an article that might be published in a NOUN like psychology today , which VERB a general NOUN with an interest in psychology , scientific NOUN generally VERB NOUN - VERB journal articles VERB at an NOUN of NOUN and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is where NOUN comes into play . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the extent to which a given NOUN or tool ADV measures what it ’s VERB to measure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while any ADJ measure is by NOUN ADJ , the reverse is not necessarily true . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we want our researcher to be ADJ — perhaps standing at NUM of the NOUN VERB to put in contact NOUN while ADV VERB the ADJ information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of ADJ study is called ADJ observation : VERB behavior in its natural setting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to better understand NOUN NOUN , PROPN PROPN VERB with NOUN at the university of texas to VERB the behavior of ADJ children on a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another potential problem in ADJ research is NOUN bias . <sent_end> <sent_begin> generally , people who act as NOUN are closely involved in the research project and may ADV VERB their observations to fit their research goals or expectations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN allow researchers to VERB data from larger NOUN than may be VERB by other research methods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a sample is a NOUN of individuals selected from a population , which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in . <sent_end> <sent_begin> researchers study the sample and seek to VERB their NOUN to the population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another approach is cross - ADJ research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in cross - ADJ research , a researcher VERB multiple NOUN of the population at the same time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> using the ADJ NOUN example above , the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of your responsibilities is to VERB the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents ’ tax dollars . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the new governor , you need to decide whether to continue funding the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( drug abuse resistance education ) program in public schools ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this program typically involves police officers coming into the NOUN to VERB students about the NOUN of becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the types of reasoning within the NOUN are called ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ reasoning , ideas are VERB against the ADJ world ; in ADJ reasoning , ADJ observations lead to new ideas ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these processes are ADJ , like VERB and VERB , but different research VERB place different emphasis on the ADJ and ADJ aspects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a scientific hypothesis is also ADJ , or capable of being shown to be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall from the ADJ chapter that PROPN freud had NOUN of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the word psychology was VERB at a time when the concepts of NOUN and mind were not as clearly VERB ( green , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the root NOUN VERB scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since science studies only ADJ phenomena and the mind is not directly ADJ , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . the scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to VERB knowledge . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different ADJ NOUN that would be VERB in a traditional college of liberal NOUN and NOUN . the requirements to earn a NOUN vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is essentially a long research paper or VERB published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate ’s ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , a NOUN generally has to be VERB before a committee of PROPN NOUN before the degree is VERB ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the ADJ NOUN described in the VERB section . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ of the discipline ’s diversity is the diversity seen within the american psychological association ( apa ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the apa is a ADJ organization representing psychologists in the united states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological experience of sensory information work within the area of NOUN and perception ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as such , NOUN and perception research is also quite ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching NOUN , providing ADJ NOUN into the differences in physical , cognitive , and social NOUN that exist between very young children and adults . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , research by PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> object NOUN refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist , even if they are VERB from us . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that NUM trait NOUN are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NUM NOUN are known as the “ big five ” or the five factor model , and include NOUN of NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the NOUN ( e.g. , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) and is influenced by NOUN ( e.g. , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> industrial - organizational psychology ( i - NOUN psychology ) is a NOUN of psychology that VERB psychological theories , principles , and research NOUN in industrial and organizational NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> i - NOUN psychologists are often involved in issues related to NOUN management , organizational structure , and workplace environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> researchers in NOUN and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of NOUN performance , including NOUN and performance anxiety , and the effects of NOUN on mental and emotional NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as mentioned earlier , both freud and rogers provided NOUN that have been ADJ in VERB how NOUN interact with people seeking NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while aspects of the ADJ theory are still found among some of today ’s NOUN who are VERB from a ADJ perspective , PROPN ’s ideas about NOUN - VERB therapy have been especially ADJ in VERB how many NOUN operate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> furthermore , both NOUN and the cognitive revolution have shaped ADJ practice in the forms of behavioral therapy , cognitive therapy , and cognitive - behavioral therapy ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN used NOUN ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone VERB their own conscious experience as ADV as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s version of NOUN used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a ADV ADJ ( ADJ ) experience of the mind ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as james saw it , psychology ’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these men are VERB with VERB psychologists in the united states to various PROPN principles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word PROPN roughly VERB to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of PROPN psychology NOUN with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual VERB to in perception . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NOUN may be made up of individual NOUN VERB by different NOUN , but the real nature of the NOUN is perceived in the NOUN of these NOUN as they form the NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because he believed that ADJ analysis of the mind was impossible , PROPN VERB to focus directly on ADJ behavior and try to bring that behavior under control . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN was a major NOUN of VERB the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of VERB and VERB behavior came to be known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a major object of study by NOUN was learned behavior and its interaction with ADJ NOUN of the organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , NOUN emerged . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a perspective within psychology that VERB the potential for good that is innate to all humans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most well - known NOUN of ADJ psychology are abraham PROPN and PROPN rogers ( PROPN , PROPN . ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> culture has important NOUN on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under - studied . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , american NOUN could be VERB to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is ADJ to be true ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in between these NOUN are states of consciousness related to NOUN , NOUN as a result of alcohol or other drug use , ADJ states , ADJ states , and VERB states of consciousness following sleep NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if we have biological NOUN , then is there some NOUN of biological NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the brain , the hypothalamus , which VERB above the pituitary gland , is a main center of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , most people sleep during the night and are ADJ during the day . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM important NOUN of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases NOUN , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological NOUN and of the immune system during sleep ( PROPN , PROPN - PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when we do this , we often experience NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN is a collection of symptoms that results from the NOUN between our internal ADJ cycles and our environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these symptoms include NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or VERB ADJ for at least NUM NOUN a week over a NOUN ’s time ) ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day - to - day life , they VERB a sleep debt . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a ADJ basis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the consequences of sleep debt include VERB levels of NOUN and mental efficiency . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM popular hypothesis of sleep VERB the perspective of evolutionary psychology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> evolutionary psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of natural selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> variations and NOUN in NOUN and behavior make individuals more or less successful in VERB and passing their genes to their offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first stage of PROPN sleep is known as stage NUM sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> stage NUM sleep is a ADJ phase that occurs between NOUN and sleep , the period during which we VERB off to sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during this time , there is a NOUN in both the rates of respiration and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we move into stage NUM sleep , the body goes into a state of deep relaxation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN waves still VERB the activity of the brain , but they are VERB by brief NOUN of activity known as sleep NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> stage NUM and stage NUM of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow - wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency ( up to NUM hz ) , high amplitude NOUN waves ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during this time , an individual ’s heart rate and respiration slow ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN content is the actual content , or NOUN , of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ content , on the other hand , refers to the VERB meaning of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , if a woman dreams about being VERB by a NOUN , freud might have argued that this represents the woman ’s fear of sexual NOUN , with the NOUN serving as a NOUN of a man ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some forms of NOUN , such as cognitive - behavioral therapy , can help NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cognitive - behavioral therapy is a type of NOUN that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the treatment of NOUN likely would include stress management techniques and changes in ADJ behaviors that could contribute to NOUN ( e.g. , spending more NOUN time in NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rem sleep behavior disorder ( PROPN ) occurs when the muscle NOUN associated with the rem sleep phase does not occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals who VERB from PROPN have high levels of physical activity during rem sleep , especially during ADJ dreams . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sleep NOUN is defined by NOUN during which a NOUN ’s NOUN VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN can last NUM NOUN or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in central sleep NOUN , NOUN in signals sent from the brain that regulate NOUN cause periods of ADJ NOUN ( white , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most common NOUN for sleep NOUN involves the use of a special device during sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a continuous positive NOUN pressure ( PROPN ) device includes a NOUN that VERB over the NOUN ’s NOUN and mouth , which is connected to a NOUN that VERB air into the person ’s PROPN , VERB them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some ADJ NOUN NOUN are smaller and cover only the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with NOUN can not VERB falling ADJ at ADJ times . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these sleep NOUN are often associated with NOUN , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle NOUN , and in some cases involves complete NOUN of the voluntary muscles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is similar to the kind of NOUN experienced by healthy individuals during rem sleep ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in individuals VERB with a substance use disorder , there is a ADJ pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological NOUN . physical NOUN involves changes in normal ADJ functions — the NOUN will experience NOUN from the drug upon NOUN of use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , a person who has psychological NOUN has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to VERB psychological distress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is linked to physiological NOUN , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , which we commonly refer to as alcohol , is in a class of ADJ drugs known as NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a drug that tends to VERB central nervous system activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other NOUN include NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and PROPN NOUN seek a ADJ high , feelings of ADJ NOUN and NOUN , especially in those NOUN who take the drug via ADJ NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> repeated use of these NOUN can have significant ADJ consequences . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN is NUM of a category of drugs that includes NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have ADJ properties ; that is , they decrease pain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is a ADJ NOUN that is less ADJ than NOUN and similar drugs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN help people who previously VERB with ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN symptoms through the use of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other drugs , including the NOUN NOUN , have also been used to VERB symptoms of NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is a state of extreme self - focus and attention in which ADJ attention is given to external stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the ADJ setting , a NOUN may use relaxation and NOUN in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these cells VERB NOUN , in the form of action NOUN ( as you learned when studying PROPN ) , to the central nervous system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes , we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as the just ADJ difference ( PROPN ) or difference threshold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike the absolute threshold , the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> an individual firm may find itself VERB by ADJ supply and demand conditions or VERB by ADJ or ADJ ADJ decisions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , a standard NOUN from financial investors is NOUN , which means buying NOUN or bonds from a wide range of companies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN who VERB is following the old NOUN : “ do n’t put all your eggs in NUM NOUN . ” in any broad group of companies , some firms will do better than expected and some will do ADJ — but the NOUN have a tendency to VERB out extreme increases and decreases in value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> about NUM - NOUN of u.s. households own their own home . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN ’s NOUN in a house is the monetary value the NOUN would have after selling the house and VERB any ADJ bank loans used to buy the house . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , imagine that you buy a house for $ NUM , paying NUM % of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> compound interest is an interest rate NOUN on the NOUN plus the VERB interest . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , congress passed and president george w. bush signed into law the PROPN campaign reform act ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the relatively ADJ portions of the act VERB the rules requiring full and ADJ NOUN of who VERB money to campaigns . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in environmental protection and negative externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in monopoly and antitrust policy ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or NOUN on how to VERB environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has NOUN who study every word and every NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the political pressure to pass a NOUN drug benefit for medicare was ADV quite high , while the political pressure to VERB the NUM NUM with no health insurance at all was ADV lower . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM reason might be that senior citizens are represented by PROPN , a well - funded and well - organized lobbying group , while there is no NOUN organization to lobby for those without health insurance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , policies that impose price controls — like NOUN control — may look as if they benefit NOUN and impose costs only on NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , when NOUN then decide to reduce the number of ADJ units available in the area , a number of people who would have VERB to VERB an NOUN end up living ADV else because no units were available . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> democracy is sometimes VERB up ( and VERB ) in NUM words : “ majority rule . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> when voters face NUM or more choices , however , then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the situation in which choice a is VERB by a majority over choice b , choice b is VERB by a majority over choice c , and choice c is VERB by a majority over choice a is called a voting cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is easy to imagine sets of government choices — say , perhaps the choice between increased defense spending , increased government spending on health care , and a tax cut — in which a voting cycle could occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in april NUM , the union representing u.s. NOUN VERB workers VERB a NOUN with the u.s. international trade commission ( PROPN ) , VERB it to VERB NOUN imports from china . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under u.s. trade law , if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market NOUN in the united states , as determined by the PROPN , then it can also VERB a NOUN for this market NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this demand can be divided into NUM main parts : consumer spending ( consumption ) , business spending ( investment ) , government spending on goods and services , and spending on net exports . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see the following clear it up feature to understand what is meant by investment . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the net NOUN component of gdp is equal to the dollar value of exports ( x ) minus the dollar value of imports ( m ) , ( x – m ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] ( b ) also shows that imports and exports have both VERB substantially in recent decades , even after the NOUN during the great recession between NUM and NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as noted before , if exports and imports are equal , foreign trade has no effect on total gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to avoid this problem , which would VERB the size of the economy ADV , government NOUN VERB just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are VERB from gdp NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> net national product ( PROPN ) is calculated by taking PROPN and then VERB the value of how much physical capital is VERB out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process by which capital NOUN and VERB value is called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> similarly , if you do not know the rate of inflation , it is difficult to figure out if a rise in gdp is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nominal value of any economic NOUN means the NOUN is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the real value refers to the same NOUN after it has been adjusted for inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows the u.s. nominal and real gdp since NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because NUM is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a significant decline in real gdp is called a recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an especially ADJ and deep recession is called a depression . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the severe NOUN in gdp that occurred during the great depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the great recession of NUM – NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , a recession VERB from peak to NOUN , and an economic NOUN runs from NOUN to peak . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the movement of the economy from peak to NOUN and NOUN to peak is called the business cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is ADJ to VERB that the NUM ADJ NOUN - to - peak NOUN of the twentieth century have VERB since NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country a ’s currency that need to be VERB for a single unit of country b ’s currency ( for example , japanese NOUN per british NOUN ) , or as the NOUN ( for example , british NOUN per japanese NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose , market exchange rates and purchasing power NOUN ( PROPN ) ADJ exchange rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> market exchange rates vary on a day - to - day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM ADJ change in the u.s. economy in recent decades is that , as of NUM , only about NUM % of women VERB in the paid labor force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by the second decade of the NOUN , nearly NUM % of women VERB in the paid labor force according to the bureau of labor statistics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as women are now in the labor force , many of the services they used to produce in the non - market economy like food NOUN and child care have VERB to some extent into the market economy , which makes the gdp appear larger even if more services are not actually being VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before the last NUM centuries , although NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN could VERB some NOUN and although economies VERB above the NOUN level , the average person ’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> progressive , powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late ADJ and early nineteenth centuries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the ADJ economic NOUN PROPN PROPN van PROPN , slavery - based societies , ADJ NOUN , global trading NOUN , and ADJ trading institutions that spread with different NOUN set the stage for the industrial revolution to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the industrial revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven NOUN and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economic growth depends on many factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> key among those factors is NOUN to the rule of law and protection of property rights and ADJ rights by a country ’s government so that markets can work effectively and ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> laws must be clear , public , ADJ , VERB , and equally ADJ to all members of society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second factor that VERB labor productivity is technological change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> technological change is a combination of NOUN — NOUN in knowledge — and innovation , which is VERB that NOUN to use in a new product or service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the NOUN was VERB in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while productivity growth was high in NUM and NUM ( around NUM % ) , it has VERB down since then . <sent_end> <sent_begin> productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over time , the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will VERB on the value of the output those workers produce . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the category of technology is the “ NOUN in the NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> earlier we described it as the combination of NOUN and innovation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when most people think of new technology , the NOUN of new products like the NOUN , the NOUN , or some new NOUN drug come to mind . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when society increases the level of capital per person , the result is called capital VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea of capital NOUN can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some low - income and middle - income economies around the world have shown a pattern of NOUN , in which their economies grow ADV than those of high - income countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gdp increased by an average rate of NUM % per year in the NUM and NUM % per year from NUM to NUM in the high - income countries of the world , which include the united states , canada , the countries of the european union , PROPN , PROPN , and new PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how did these NOUN increase ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the neoclassical growth NOUN uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital VERB to create growth and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are some people who have only part time or ADJ jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed , though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be . <sent_end> <sent_begin> additionally , there are individuals who are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this includes those that are VERB or skilled for NUM type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not VERB their skills . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there does not seem to be a long - term NOUN toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( source : federal reserve economic data ( PROPN ) PROPN ) " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM primary NOUN of the demand for labor from firms is how they VERB the state of the ADJ economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if firms believe that business is expanding , then at any given wage they will VERB to hire a greater quantity of labor , and the labor demand curve shifts to the right . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other words , these people are ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what causes ADJ unemployment ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an ADJ contract , which is that the NOUN will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having NOUN , and the employee will not expect huge NOUN increases when the economy or the business is strong . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this wage - setting behavior acts like a form of insurance : the employee has some protection against wage NOUN in bad times , but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN - NOUN model of the labor force , in simple terms , VERB that those already working for firms are “ NOUN , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> a firm depends on its NOUN to VERB the NOUN of the organization , to be familiar with ADJ NOUN , to VERB new employees , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , VERB wages will VERB the NOUN and damage the firm ’s productivity and NOUN . finally , the relative wage NOUN argument points out that even if most workers were ADV willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a ADJ economy to VERB such a plan . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a market economy , some companies are always going ADJ for a variety of reasons : old technology ; poor management ; good management that VERB to make bad decisions ; shifts in NOUN of consumers so that less of the firm ’s product is VERB ; a large NOUN who went ADJ ; or ADJ domestic or foreign NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , NOUN of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> wages are typically VERB only once or DET a year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in many modern jobs , it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sure , the average worker in NUM is better ADJ and more productive than the average worker in NUM — but not NUM times more productive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sure , per capita gdp increased substantially from NUM to NUM , but is the average person in the u.s. economy really more than NUM times better off in just NUM years ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> not likely . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are ADV VERB in the NOUN of supply and demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB the task of VERB the price levels for more ADJ and complex NOUN of goods , the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number , rather than as the dollar amount for buying the NOUN of goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> price NOUN are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN is calculated by government NOUN at the u.s. bureau of labor statistics based on the prices in a fixed NOUN of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in recent years , the NOUN have paid considerable attention to a ADJ problem : that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed NOUN of goods and services over time is ADV not quite the same as the change in the cost of living , because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we VERB learned , PROPN measures prices as they affect everyday household spending . <sent_end> <sent_begin> well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the PROPN and VERB ADJ economic variables . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this way , economists have a better sense of the underlying NOUN in prices that affect the cost of living . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is an international price index based on the prices of NOUN that is VERB or imported . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gdp NOUN , measured by the bureau of economic analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of gdp ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower , as in the recession of NUM – NUM , the great depression , the recession of NUM – NUM , and the great recession in NUM – NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there were a few months in NUM that were ADJ , but not at an annual rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what are the economic problems caused by inflation , and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider a very short story : “ the land of PROPN money . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the problem of a good - looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ADV - looking real interest rate can be VERB by taxes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms , without an NOUN for inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the worker VERB these funds in a wide range of investment NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these plans are tax VERB , and they are ADJ so that if the individual takes a job with a different NOUN , their NUM ) comes with them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return , NOUN do not VERB from the inflation costs of traditional NOUN . however , ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the ADJ NOUN of inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> inflation can make long - term NOUN difficult . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in VERB ADJ NOUN , we considered the case of someone trying to plan for NOUN with a NOUN that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similar problems arise for all people trying to save for NOUN , because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a wide NOUN of NOUN NOUN is observed in private markets and government programs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the negative effects of inflation VERB in large part on having inflation ADV affect NUM part of the economy but not another — say , increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive — NOUN will take some of the NOUN out of inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the social security program offers NUM examples of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the passage of the social security PROPN act of NUM , the level of social security benefits increases each year along with the consumer price index . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also , social security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount — $ NUM in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports VERB imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if imports VERB exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a few decades ago , it was common to VERB the solid or physical items that were transported by NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this measurement is called the NOUN trade balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in most high - income economies , including the united states , goods make up less than half of a country ’s total production , while services VERB more than half . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> statistics on the balance of trade are VERB by the bureau of economic analysis ( PROPN ) within the u.s. department of commerce , using a variety of different sources . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the final category of the current account balance is ADJ NOUN , which are payments made by government , private NOUN , or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economic or military assistance from the u.s. government to other countries VERB into this category , as does spending abroad by NOUN to address poverty or social NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the story of PROPN and PROPN also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage , which you learn more about in the international trade chapter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following work it out feature steps you through VERB comparative advantage for the NOUN and NOUN VERB between the united states and great britain in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB comparative advantage <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the NOUN of the trade and current account balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the trade deficit rises , it necessarily means a greater net NOUN of foreign financial capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the national saving and investment identity VERB that the rest of the economy can absorb this NOUN of foreign financial capital in several different ways . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a nation ’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade , but these NUM are actually quite separate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade — measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its gdp — while it also has a near - balance between exports and imports . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation ’s production is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the next NUM NOUN take up this task . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this chapter VERB the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the NUM interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this chapter also VERB the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the NUM goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and NOUN between these goals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the bottom line remains , however , that every NOUN represents income to someone , and so , say ’s law VERB , a given value of supply must create an ADJ value of demand ADV else in the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because PROPN - PROPN say , PROPN smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally VERB to the say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the NOUN are called neoclassical economists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as say PRON recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms VERB losses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the alternative to say ’s law , with its emphasis on supply , can be named keynes ’ law : “ demand creates its own supply . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a matter of ADJ NOUN , just as PROPN - PROPN say never wrote down PRON as ADJ as say ’s law , john PROPN keynes never wrote down keynes ’ law , but the law is a useful NOUN that VERB a certain point of view . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when keynes wrote his great work the general theory of employment , interest , and money during the great depression of the 1930s , he VERB out that during the depression , the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much . <sent_end> <sent_begin> u.s. unemployment rates VERB higher than NUM % from NUM to NUM , but the number of possible workers had not increased or VERB much . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the new york times brought back the ADJ model , which VERB NOUN and NOUN and VERB NOUN in government and politics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with the NOUN of the progressive era , the media began NOUN : the writing and NOUN of news coverage that exposed ADJ business and government practices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ work like PROPN PROPN ’s VERB NOUN the PROPN led to changes in the way industrial workers were treated and local political NOUN were run . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM NOUN described the NOUN as ADJ , with the president acting like a NOUN , VERB in the room with the family , VERB through the political NOUN and describing what help he needed from each family member . PROPN PROPN PROPN , ” PROPN ( november NUM , NUM ) ; NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> american media history , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> roosevelt would VERB down and explain his ideas and actions directly to the people on a ADJ basis , ADJ that he could VERB voters of their value . PROPN : a voice of PROPN , ” PROPN ( september NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his NOUN became known as “ PROPN NOUN ” and formed an important way for him to promote his new deal agenda ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> roosevelt ’s combination of ADJ NOUN and the media allowed him to expand both the government and the presidency beyond their traditional roles . PROPN e. PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the commission was under ADJ pressure from congress , however , and had little authority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN act of NUM ended the PROPN and created the federal PROPN commission ( PROPN ) , which continued to work with radio stations to VERB frequencies and set national standards , as well as ADJ other forms of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN VERB interstate NOUN to this day . <sent_end>

PROPN jefferson clinton : PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN service address , ” NUM april NUM , X . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social media , like PROPN , also placed NOUN in the hands of citizens : citizen NOUN occurs when citizens use their personal NOUN NOUN and cell NOUN to capture events and post them on the internet . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , citizen journalists VERB both presidential candidates by NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> 2 : NUM june NUM , PROPN PROPN of the PROPN report took his soft news show on the NOUN , VERB to iraq for a week . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the first NOUN , PROPN VERB ray PROPN , VERB general of the NOUN forces VERB in iraq . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : the u.s. army ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the radio act of NUM was the first attempt by congress to regulate NOUN materials . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the act was written to organize the rapidly expanding number of radio stations and the NOUN of frequencies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> hence , there ADV may be a NOUN in which NOUN can give free time to just NUM candidate ’s supporters . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NUM PROPN ADJ recall election , scott PROPN ’s supporters were ADV given free air time to raise funds and VERB for NOUN while NOUN PROPN PROPN ’s supporters were not . PROPN wilson , “ PROPN : no more equal time requirements for political campaign supporters over our public PROPN , ” PROPN post , NUM may NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to someone involved in the case , the PROPN VERB to VERB after a NOUN was VERB on the matter , VERB the equal - time rule applied only to the actual candidates , and that the case was an instance of the now - dead NOUN doctrine . william lake , NOUN from the PROPN regarding PROPN texas PROPN , NUM may NUM , PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN doctrine was VERB in NUM and required ADJ stations to cover controversial issues in a ADJ manner by providing NOUN with information about all NOUN on any controversial issue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NUM candidate , cause , or NOUN was given an opportunity to reach the NOUN or NOUN , the other side was to be given a chance to present its side as well . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> this VERB the question of how the media , even general NOUN , can affect citizens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the ways is through NOUN : the creation of a NOUN , or context , for a news story . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the news often uses NOUN to place a story in a context so the NOUN VERB its importance or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this study supports the argument that VERB sound NOUN are a way for journalists to control the story and add their own analysis rather than just report on it . PROPN PROPN , “ the ADJ VERB sound NOUN , ” boston PROPN , NUM january NUM , PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> candidates are given a few NOUN to try to argue their side of an issue , but some say television focuses on the argument rather than on information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , PROPN PROPN of PROPN central ’s the daily show began VERB the PROPN program PROPN for being NOUN , VERB the NOUN VERB in ADJ and ADJ NOUN rather than true NOUN .

<sent_begin> most journalists in the early NUM were male , and women ’s issues were not part of the NOUN discussion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as NOUN PROPN PROPN put it , the women ’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s was about raising awareness of the problems of equality , but writing about NOUN “ was like trying to VERB PROPN - PROPN to the wall . PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it takes a candidate : why women do n’t run for office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN : PROPN university press . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many women do not VERB to VERB their children or NOUN to NOUN . PROPN PROPN PROPN , “ running with NOUN : the impact of family life on political PROPN , ” PROPN institute of politics , spring NUM , PROPN paper , PROPN / research / documents / PROPN - PROPN - political - NOUN ( august NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the nomination of PROPN PROPN as republican candidate john PROPN ’s running mate VERB this concern ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some articles focused on her NOUN to be a potential future president or her record on the issues . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> u.s. elections are based on NOUN voting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes VERB , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( NUM percent or greater ) of the total votes VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , abraham lincoln won the presidency in NUM even though he clearly VERB majority support given the number of candidates in the race . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the election is over , supporters experience NOUN when their least - ADJ candidate VERB instead . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in the NUM election , PROPN PROPN ran for president as the candidate of the green party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , a ADJ consumer NOUN concerned with environmental issues and social justice , VERB many votes from people who usually VERB for democratic candidates . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> electoral rules are probably not the only reason the united states has a NUM - party system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we need only look at the number of parties in the british or ADJ systems , both of which are NOUN - take - all NOUN systems like that in the united states , to see that it is possible to have more than NUM parties while still directly VERB representatives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , people who describe themselves as ADJ PROPN are an important republican NOUN ; they are also strongly opposed to abortion . PROPN PROPN , “ the NUM most ADJ ADJ groups for republicans and democrats , ” the washington post , NUM april NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , even though the majority of u.s. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances , such as when a NOUN is the result of NOUN or NOUN , or VERB the life of the mother , the position of many republican presidential candidates in NUM was to VERB abortion in all cases . PROPN PROPN , “ PROPN candidates : ban abortion , no PROPN , ” NUM august NUM , PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , many women view the republican party as ADJ to their interests and are more likely to support democratic candidates . PROPN PROPN , “ the NUM most ADJ ADJ groups for republicans and democrats . ” similarly ( or simultaneously ) , groups that have felt that the party has served their causes in the past may decide to look ADV if they feel their needs are no longer being met . <sent_end> <sent_begin> either way , the party system will be VERB as a result of a party NOUN , or a NOUN of party NOUN within the NOUN ( [ ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> key . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that change began with the NUM presidential campaign of franklin PROPN roosevelt . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN determined that his best path toward victory was to create a new NOUN based not on region or NOUN , but on the NOUN of those VERB the most during the great depression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at its most basic level , being a member of the party - in - the - NOUN simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these voters are often called party NOUN , since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party , and they may VERB some party events or functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> party NOUN are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second , the state organization is also responsible for VERB a state NOUN that serves as a policy NOUN for NOUN who are eventually selected to public office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are usually the result of a NOUN between the various NOUN within the party and are designed to ensure that everyone in the party will receive some benefits if their candidates win the election . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this has been particularly true for the democratic party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the democrats VERB PROPN governor bill clinton to VERB their nominee michael PROPN at the convention . <sent_end> <sent_begin> clinton ’s speech was VERB for its length and lack of focus , but it served to get his name in front of democratic voters . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the issue is important enough to voters , as in the case of gun control or abortion rights , an office NOUN may feel his or her job will be in NOUN if he or she too closely follows the party line , even if that means VERB with the executive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a good example occurred when the civil rights act of NUM , which VERB public NOUN and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , was introduced in congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bill was supported by presidents john f. kennedy and PROPN johnson , both of whom were democrats . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the problem of majority versus minority politics is particularly ADJ under conditions of divided government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> divided government occurs when NUM or more houses of the legislature are controlled by the party in opposition to the executive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recently , however , a new voice has emerged that has VERB itself with the republican party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> born in part from an older third - party movement known as the PROPN party , the tea party is more hostile to government and views government NOUN in all forms , and especially NOUN and the regulation of business , as a threat to NOUN and democracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is less willing to VERB NOUN in the market place , even when they are designed to protect the markets themselves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scholars agree that some degree of polarization is occurring in the united states , even if some VERB it is only at the elite level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but they are less certain about exactly why , or how , polarization has become such a NOUN of american politics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first NOUN came with the NOUN of the “ NUM - person - NUM - vote ” principle by the u.s. supreme court in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before then , it was common for many states to practice NOUN , or NOUN of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost NOUN in the u.s. house of representatives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this can happen once every NUM years as a result of a ADV ADJ NOUN process , in which the number of house NOUN given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next NUM NOUN cycles ( NUM and NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> map NOUN , no longer certain how to protect individual party members , changed NOUN to try and create safe NOUN so members of their party could be VERB of VERB by a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the basic rule of NOUN was that NOUN sought to draw NOUN in which their ADJ party had a NUM percent or better chance of VERB a given district , regardless of which candidate the party VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is where political parties come in . <sent_end> <sent_begin> essentially , political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and VERB policies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they do this by VERB control over the government by VERB elections . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , PROPN : PROPN press , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federalist NOUN , led by PROPN hamilton , largely dominated the government in the years immediately after the constitution was ratified . <sent_end> <sent_begin> included in the federalists was president george washington , who was initially against the existence of parties in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when washington decided to exit politics and leave office , he VERB of the potential negative effects of parties in his ADJ address to the nation , including their ADV ADJ nature and the fact that they might not always focus on the common good but rather on ADJ ends . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the election of NUM , numerous candidates VERB for the presidency , all members of the democratic - republican party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> andrew jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the electoral college than any other candidate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the house of representatives , as required by the PROPN amendment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM half , called simply the democratic party , was the party of jackson ; it continued to VERB for the common people by VERB NOUN expansion and VERB a national bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the branch of the democratic - republicans that believed that the national government should encourage economic ( primarily industrial ) development was ADV known as the national republicans and later became the PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ democratic - republican party , ” in PROPN PROPN of u.s. history , PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at various points in the past NUM years , NOUN and voters have sought to create NOUN to the existing party system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> political parties that are formed as NOUN to the republican and democratic parties are known as third parties , or minor parties ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , a third party known as the PROPN party formed in reaction to what its constituents perceived as the NOUN of u.s. society by big business and a decline in the power of farmers and ADJ communities . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s campaign was a failure , largely because most people believed his policies , including national healthcare , were too much like those of NOUN , and this party also VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other third party , the states ’ rights democrats , also known as the PROPN , were white , southern democrats who split from the democratic party when PROPN PROPN , who VERB civil rights for african americans , became the party ’s nominee for president . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN opposed all attempts by the federal government to end segregation , extend voting rights , VERB discrimination in employment , or otherwise promote social equality among NOUN . PROPN of the states rights democratic party , ” NOUN / NOUN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they remained a significant party that VERB democratic NOUN throughout the 1950s and 1960s . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in federalist no . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM , james madison VERB of the NOUN of “ NOUN , ” NOUN who would organize around issues they felt strongly about , ADV to the NOUN of the majority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but madison believed limiting these NOUN was ADJ than VERB the NOUN they might produce , because such NOUN would VERB individual freedoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> largely for this reason , there is no ADJ list of all interest groups to VERB us how many there are in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of the number vary widely , VERB that if we use a broad definition and include all interests at all levels of government , there may be more than NUM , interest groups in american politics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> following the passage of the lobbying PROPN act in NUM , we had a much better understanding of the number of interests VERB in washington , dc ; however , it was not until several years later that we had a complete NOUN and NOUN of the interests VERB in each of the NUM states . PROPN PROPN , PROPN PROPN PROPN , PROPN PROPN , david PROPN , and virginia PROPN , “ much of politics is still local : PROPN representation in state interest communities , ” legislative studies PROPN NUM ( NUM ) : NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> governments such as NOUN and executive NOUN such as the department of education register to lobby in an effort to VERB their share of NOUN or increase their level of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these government institutions are represented by a legislative NOUN , whose job is to present issues to decision - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a state university usually VERB a NOUN , legislative NOUN , or government affairs person to represent its interests before the legislature . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> many NOUN also use outside lobbying or ADJ lobbying NOUN , ADV the interest attempts to get its message out to the public . PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such collective goods are benefits — ADJ or ADJ — that help most or all citizens . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the answer is that they likely prefer to do something else and VERB they can receive the same NOUN as the rest of the group without VERB to the effort . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this result is often termed the free NOUN problem , because some individuals can receive benefits ( get a free NOUN ) without helping to bear the cost . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when national public radio ( PROPN ) VERB in a fund - raising effort to help maintain the NOUN , many NOUN will not contribute . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> similarly , ADJ NOUN focus on the issues or causes VERB by the group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> someone concerned about protecting individual rights might join a group like the american civil liberties union ( PROPN ) because it supports the liberties VERB in the u.s. constitution , even the free expression of ADJ PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> members of the PROPN sometimes find the NOUN of those they VERB ( including PROPN and the PROPN PROPN PROPN ) ADJ , but they argue that the principle of protecting civil liberties is critical to u.s. democracy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more recently , several VERB NOUN of ADJ young african american men have raised awareness of racial issues in the united states and potential problems in NOUN practices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , ferguson , PROPN , VERB in NOUN and NOUN following a decision not to VERB PROPN wilson , a white police NOUN , in the ADJ NOUN of michael brown , who had ADV been involved in a NOUN at a local NOUN store and ended up in a NOUN with the NOUN .

<sent_begin> ADV , the NOUN would likely have received little NOUN , but by VERB with others , they VERB substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the tea party movement might not meet the definition of interest groups presented earlier , its NOUN have been VERB by established interest groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other opportunities for participation that interest groups offer or encourage include voting , NOUN , VERB lawmakers , and VERB the public about causes . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> according to political scientists PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN , interest groups provide a means of representing people and serve as a link between them and government . see in general PROPN PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how do these observations VERB into the way different interests are represented in the political system ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> some ADJ scholars like david PROPN suggest that people naturally join groups and that there will be a great deal of competition for access to decision - NOUN . david b.

<sent_begin> today , the debate about interest groups often VERB around whether the first amendment protects the rights of individuals and groups to give money , and whether government can regulate the use of this money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the federal election campaign act was passed , setting limits on how much presidential and vice - presidential candidates and their families could VERB to their own campaigns . PROPN , interest groups and congress : lobbying , contributions , and influence ; PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , interest groups in american campaigns : the new face of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law also allowed corporations and unions to form pacs and required public NOUN of campaign contributions and their sources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the act was VERB in an attempt to limit the amount of money spent on congressional campaigns . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , at the same time , it VERB restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . PROPN v. PROPN , NUM - NUM , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> conservative NOUN charles and david PROPN have become increasingly active in u.s. elections in recent years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN run PROPN industries , a ADJ corporation that VERB and produces a number of products including paper , NOUN , NOUN - based products , and chemicals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the need to ADV regulate the actions of NOUN became especially ADJ after the activities of NOUN PROPN PROPN were brought to light ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a prominent NOUN with NOUN to many of the republican members of congress , PROPN used funds provided by his clients to fund NOUN campaigns , pay for NOUN , and hire the NOUN of members of congress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> large states , like virginia , felt it would be ADJ to continue with this style of legislative institution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , virginia ’s delegates proposed a plan that called for NOUN , or the division of legislators into NUM separate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this proposed NUM - chamber congress , states with larger populations would have more representatives in each chamber . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ system established at the constitutional convention and still followed today requires the NUM houses to pass identical bills , or proposed items of legislation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB that after all VERB and NOUN has occurred , the NUM houses ultimately reach an agreement about the legislation they VERB to the president . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> attempts at african american NOUN continued until the civil rights NOUN of the 1960s finally brought about the voting rights act of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the act VERB several final NOUN to voter registration and voting for african americans . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an enumerated power is a power ADV stated in the constitution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ power is NUM not specifically detailed in the constitution but VERB as necessary to achieve the NOUN of the national government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and an ADJ power , while not enumerated or VERB , must be VERB to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these include congress ’s ADJ power to VERB legislation , the senate ’s final say on many presidential NOUN and NOUN signed by the president , and the house ’s ability to VERB or ADV VERB the president or other federal officials of NOUN ( the first step in VERB the person from office ; the second step , trial and removal , takes place in the u.s. senate ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each of these powers also grants congress NOUN of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and VERB other bodies such as the executive branch . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fact that congress has the ADJ power to VERB legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is VERB to enforce . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the early days of the republic , congress ’s role was ADV if ever VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , with its decision in PROPN v. madison ( NUM ) , the supreme court VERB its authority over judicial review and VERB the power to VERB laws unconstitutional . PROPN v. madison , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet , even after that decision , the court was ADJ to use this power and did n’t do so for over half a century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> initially , the presidency was also a fairly weak branch of government compared with the legislature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> his NOUN and his ability to be elected NUM times allowed him to greatly VERB congress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a result , congress attempted to VERB the power of the presidency by VERB the twenty - second amendment to the constitution , which limited a president to only NUM full terms in office . david PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another NOUN of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of world war ii , but then congress VERB campaign NOUN reform for a few decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that NOUN ended in the early 1970s when the federal election campaign act was passed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> among other things , it created the federal election commission ( PROPN ) , required candidates to VERB where their money was coming from and where they were spending it , limited individual contributions , and provided for public NOUN of presidential campaigns . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the wake of the citizens united decision , a new type of NOUN group emerged , the ADJ PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a traditional PROPN is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or VERB candidates . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> political scientists have taken note of some voting patterns that appear to challenge this common assumption , however . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , political scientist PROPN PROPN proposed the VERB - and - decline theory to explain these patterns . PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these are generally referred to as the majority and minority leaders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the minority leader has a visible if not always a powerful position . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the official leader of the opposition , he or she ADV holds the NOUN ADJ to that of the speaker , makes strategy decisions , and attempts to keep order within the minority . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> apart from this and very few other NOUN , the president of the senate does not actually operate in the senate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , the constitution allows for the senate to choose a president ADJ NOUN — usually the most senior senator of the majority party — who VERB over the senate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> despite the title , the job is largely a formal and ADJ role . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , joint committees have no bill - NOUN authority ADV — they are ADJ only . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN committee is used to VERB different bills passed in both the house and the senate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN committees are appointed on an ad X basis as necessary when a bill passes the house and senate in different forms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once legislation has been proposed , however , the majority leadership VERB with the NOUN about which committee to VERB it to . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each chamber has a NOUN , an NOUN , typically a VERB NOUN , who has studied the long and complex rules of the chamber . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the civil war , the use of the NOUN became even more common . <sent_end> <sent_begin> eventually , in NUM , the senate passed rule NUM , which allowed the chamber to hold a NOUN vote to end debate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB NOUN , the senate had to get a NUM - NOUN majority . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but they have largely been VERB by the ADJ ADJ and sometimes ADJ NOUN of the twentieth century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the first category , the NUM - and - a - half - hour NOUN of senator PROPN long of PROPN VERB out : VERB to VERB the need for senate NOUN of some jobs he wanted to keep from his political NOUN , long spent much of his NOUN VERB the constitution , VERB about his ADJ NOUN , and VERB ADJ NOUN , as was his NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN a NOUN : PROPN VERB in the u.s. congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , PROPN : PROPN state university press . <sent_end> <sent_begin> creating and voting for an ADJ bill allows congress to quickly VERB policy changes that would have taken many votes and the NOUN of great political capital over a long period of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this and ADJ similar uses of the budget process VERB many in congress of the utility of this strategy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , they ( and their NOUN members ) rely on interest groups and NOUN to provide them with information about the ADJ NOUN of policy NOUN , as well as about ADJ lawmakers ’ NOUN and constituents ’ perceptions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these voting cues give lawmakers an NOUN of how to vote on issues , particularly those with which they are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but lawmakers also rely on NOUN for information about ideas they can NOUN and that will benefit them when they run for NOUN . PROPN , interest groups and congress : lobbying , contributions , and influence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this means they are intended to be drawn from local populations around the country so they can VERB for and make decisions for those local populations , their constituents , while serving in their ADJ legislative houses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is , representation refers to an elected leader ’s looking out for his or her constituents while carrying out the NOUN of the office . PROPN PROPN smith . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , most find themselves VERB to balance the important principles embedded in each . <sent_end> <sent_begin> political scientists call this the NOUN model of representation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in it , members of congress act as either NOUN or NOUN based on rational political NOUN about who is best served , the NOUN or the nation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many NOUN in women ’s rights have been the result of women ’s greater NOUN in politics and representation in the NOUN of government , especially since the NOUN of the national organization for women in NUM and the national women ’s political PROPN ( PROPN ) in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN was formed by PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) , PROPN PROPN , PROPN PROPN , and other leading NOUN to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN PROPN ( d - PROPN ) ( [ link ] ) , the first ADJ american woman elected to congress , was the NOUN of the education amendments act of NUM , title PROPN of which VERB sex discrimination in education . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the wake of the civil rights movement , african american representatives also began to enter congress in increasing numbers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , to better represent their interests , these representatives founded the congressional black PROPN ( PROPN ) , an organization that grew out of a democratic select committee formed in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB members of the PROPN include john PROPN ( d - PROPN ) , ADV the ADV - serving member of the house of representatives , charles PROPN ( d - PROPN ) , and PROPN PROPN , a NOUN of the PROPN and the first african american woman to be elected to the house of representatives ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the concept of collective representation describes the relationship between congress and the united states as a whole . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , it VERB whether the institution itself represents the american people , not just whether a particular member of congress represents his or her district . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the articles of confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to VERB the VERB NOUN of the confederation congress , who also VERB other ADJ NOUN . articles of confederation , article PROPN , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the presidency was proposed early in the constitutional convention in PROPN by virginia ’s PROPN PROPN , as part of james madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the virginia plan . <sent_end> <sent_begin> madison offered a rather ADJ NOUN of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> PROPN hamilton ( a ) , who had served under general george washington ( b ) during the revolutionary war , argued for a strong executive in federalist no . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to win the presidency or vice presidency , a candidate must get NUM electoral votes ( a majority ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> george w. bush and PROPN PROPN won by the skin of their teeth with just NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both , however , were living in texas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> article ii of the constitution VERB out the agreed - upon requirements — the chief executive must be at least NUM - NUM years old and a “ natural born ” citizen of the united states ( or a citizen at the time of the constitution ’s NOUN ) who has been an NOUN of the united states for at least NUM years . PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> constitution , article ii , section NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while article ii also states that the term of office is NUM years and does not ADV limit the number of times a person might be elected president , after franklin d. roosevelt was elected NUM times ( from NUM to NUM ) , the twenty - second amendment was proposed and ratified , limiting the presidency to NUM NUM - year terms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the wake of the civil war , president andrew johnson faced congressional NOUN for decisions made during reconstruction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president richard nixon faced an ADJ NOUN of impeachment in the house for his cover - up of key information VERB to the NUM break - in at the democratic party ’s campaign NOUN at the PROPN NOUN and NOUN complex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nixon likely would have also been removed by the senate , since there was strong ADJ NOUN for his impeachment and removal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> no ADV had the presidency been established than the NOUN of the office , starting with george washington , began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and ADJ powers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , washington established a NOUN or group of NOUN to help him VERB his NOUN , consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today , the NOUN of the ADJ executive NOUN serve as the president ’s ADP ( may NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and , in NUM , when it became important for the united states to take a NOUN in the VERB european NOUN between france and other european powers , especially great britain , washington issued a NOUN proclamation that extended his rights as NOUN - in - chief far more ADV than had at first been VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> concerned that he might be VERB the powers of the office , jefferson VERB that his not VERB impeachment charges VERB congress ’s ADJ approval of his actions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> james PROPN used his annual message in NUM to VERB that the united states would consider it an ADJ act of aggression for european powers to VERB in the affairs of the nations of the western PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> later VERB the PROPN doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of american power in the twentieth century . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of the many ways in which the chief executive ’s power grew over the first several decades , the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while washington , adams , and jefferson led the way in VERB ADJ NOUN , it was president james PROPN PROPN who ADV set the stage for the broad growth of this authority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , as the united states and mexico were VERB over the ADJ issue of where texas ’s southern NOUN VERB , PROPN ADV raised NOUN and VERB feathers through his NOUN in mexico . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> later , however , as president PRON , lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military NOUN and national security to VERB the confederate effort to seek independence for the southern states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in VERB the NOUN of the NOUN of X PROPN , lincoln VERB the NOUN between acceptable NOUN and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he also famously used a ADJ proclamation to issue the PROPN proclamation , which VERB the military NOUN of VERB millions of slaves in confederate - controlled territory to be free . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> over the course of the twentieth century , presidents expanded and VERB upon these powers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rather ADJ NOUN in article ii , which says that the “ executive power shall be VERB ” in the president , has been subject to broad and ADJ interpretation in order to VERB actions beyond those specifically enumerated in the NOUN . PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> constitution , article ii , section NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the federal bureaucracy expanded , so too did the president ’s power to grow agencies like the secret service and the federal bureau of PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more recently , presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via VERB statements ( discussed later in this chapter ) VERB to the ADJ NOUN charged with implementation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the realm of foreign policy , congress VERB the widespread use of executive agreements to VERB international relations , so long as important matters still came through the senate in the form of NOUN . PROPN PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in december NUM , the house PROPN committee VERB secretary of treasury henry PROPN , PROPN ( bottom , left ) and acting director of the budget daniel bell ( top , right ) on the federal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : modification of work by the PROPN of congress ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> neither ronald reagan nor bill clinton was especially popular with the party leadership of the republicans or the democrats ( respectively ) at the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN phenomenon has been most clearly demonstrated , however , in the NUM presidential NOUN process , as those VERB by the party establishment , such as senator PROPN PROPN and donald trump , who never before held political office , VERB ADV of party NOUN like PROPN bush early in the primary process ( [ NOUN PROPN PROPN ( r - PROPN ) , though VERB by the party establishment , was able to rise to the top in the PROPN NOUN in NUM because of his ability to reach the conservative base of the party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ultimately , PROPN VERB out of the race when donald trump effectively VERB the republican nomination in PROPN in early may NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> early presidential elections , conducted along the lines of the original process VERB in the constitution , VERB ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so long as george washington was a candidate , his election was a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but it took some NOUN of the votes of NOUN to ensure that the second - place NOUN ( and thus the vice president ) did not receive the same number of votes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in several elections , such as in NUM and NUM , a candidate who received less than a majority of the popular vote has VERB the presidency , including cases when the VERB candidate VERB a majority of the popular vote . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a recent case was the NUM election , in which democratic nominee al PROPN won the popular vote , while republican nominee george w. bush won the electoral college vote and hence the presidency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM election brought another such NOUN as donald trump ADV won the electoral college by ADV VERB the popular vote in several states , while hillary clinton collected nearly NUM NUM more votes ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the immediate NOUN of the election , the ADJ and ADJ NOUN work together to help VERB the transfer of power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the general services administration VERB the NOUN of the process , such as office NOUN , information technology , and the NOUN of NOUN , ADJ candidates typically VERB for a possible victory by VERB members of a NOUN NOUN during the lead - up to the general election . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the success of the NOUN ’s actions becomes ADJ on NOUN day , when the NOUN of power takes place in what is often a ADJ NOUN , with people VERB their NOUN ( and the white house ) for their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , president PROPN obama VERB former republican senator PROPN PROPN to run the department of defense . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the president VERB that by VERB a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the NOUN process would go ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the republican senate and judiciary committee will VERB a trump nominee in early NUM presidential NOUN are not subject to senate approval , including the president ’s personal NOUN ( whose most important member is the white house chief of NOUN ) and various NOUN ( most ADV the national security NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the executive office of the president , created by franklin d. roosevelt ( PROPN ) , contains a number of ADJ bodies , including the council of economic PROPN , the national security council , the PROPN , and the office of the vice president . <sent_end> <sent_begin> presidents also choose political NOUN , NOUN , and a press secretary to VERB the politics and the message of the administration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but when they do , the constitution allows for a small presidential NOUN called the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ part of article ii , section NUM , of the constitution VERB : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the strategy was to get the ADJ NOUN out of the way while still taking advantage of his NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN VERB , however , when PROPN was VERB and roosevelt became president ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes , as in the case of bill clinton and al PROPN , the NOUN appeared to be smooth if not always ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of george w. bush and his very experienced vice president PROPN PROPN , NOUN VERB whether the vice president might have VERB too much influence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent NUM - term vice president , former senator PROPN PROPN , was VERB for his experience , especially in foreign policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> here , lincoln VERB with union soldiers ( a ) during his NOUN to PROPN , PROPN , on october NUM , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president PROPN PROPN grant VERB a relationship with popular NOUN thomas PROPN , who often VERB the president in the company of “ PROPN liberty ” ( b ) in addition to ADV VERB his NOUN PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN are examples of collective behavior , ADJ activity in which several or many people ADV engage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other examples are a group of NOUN VERB home from work and a population of NOUN VERB a ADJ NOUN ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really VERB , such as people standing in line at the post office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are those who come together for a ADJ event that occurs regularly , like a religious service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are people who join together to express emotion , often at NOUN , NOUN , or the like . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the final type , acting NOUN , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or NOUN . in addition to the different types of NOUN , collective groups can also be identified in NUM other ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close NOUN ( PROPN NUM ) , such as NOUN of the popular PROPN NOUN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a public , on the other hand , is an ADJ , relatively VERB group of people who share ideas , such as the ADJ political party . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ’s ( NUM ) ADJ NOUN of NOUN behavior , called value - added theory , is a perspective within the ADJ NOUN based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each condition VERB to the NOUN that collective behavior will occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social organizations worldwide take NOUN on such general areas of concern as poverty , sex NOUN , and the use of ADV modified organisms ( PROPN ) in food . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ organizations ( PROPN ) are sometimes formed to support such movements , such as the international PROPN of organic PROPN movement ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> global efforts to reduce poverty are represented by the PROPN committee for PROPN relief ( PROPN ) , among others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> religious / ADJ movements are “ meaning seeking , ” and their goal is to VERB inner change or ADJ growth in individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organizations VERB these movements include PROPN ’s PROPN or the branch PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> resource NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) VERB resource NOUN theory as a way to explain movement success in terms of the ability to VERB resources and VERB individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> resources are primarily time and money , and the more of both , the greater the power of organized movements . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> successful social movements use NUM kinds of NOUN ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) to further their goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first type , diagnostic NOUN , states the problem in a clear , easily understood way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when VERB diagnostic NOUN , there are no NOUN of NOUN : instead , there is the belief that what “ they ” do is ADJ and this is how “ we ” will VERB it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the gay marriage movement , a call to action might encourage you to vote “ no ” on PROPN NUM in california ( a move to limit marriage to male - female couples ) , or conversely , to contact your local NOUN to express your NOUN that marriage should be restricted to male - female couples . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with so many similar diagnostic NOUN , some groups find it best to join together to VERB their impact . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when social movements link their goals to the goals of other social movements and VERB into a single group , a frame NOUN process ( PROPN et al . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM ) occurs — an ADJ and ADJ means of VERB participants to the movement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how has this technology affected social change in our society and others ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM very positive way is VERB . NOUN to the web , ADJ NOUN is the process of VERB needed services , ideas , or content by VERB contributions from a large group of people , and especially from an ADJ community rather than from traditional employees or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> web - based companies such as PROPN have been created ADV for the purposes of raising large amounts of money in a short period of time , ADV by VERB the traditional NOUN process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with NUM another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists study all aspects and levels of society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is impossible to study NUM without the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> german sociologist PROPN PROPN called the process of simultaneously VERB the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an application that makes this concept ADJ is the practice of religion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this even applied to the researchers themselves , who , they believed , should be aware of how their own cultural NOUN could influence their research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to deal with this problem , PROPN and PROPN introduced the concept of PROPN , a german word that means to understand in a deep way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in seeking PROPN , outside NOUN of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an NOUN ’s point of view . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in his book the nature of social action ( NUM ) , PROPN described sociology as VERB to " VERB the meaning of social action and ADV give a ADJ explanation of the way in which action VERB and the effects it produces . " <sent_end>
<sent_begin> researchers VERB data using statistical techniques to see if they can VERB patterns of human behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ sociology VERB to understand human behavior by learning about it through in - depth NOUN , focus groups , and analysis of content sources ( like books , NOUN , NOUN , and popular media ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ - level theories relate to large - scale issues and large groups of people , while ADJ - level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ theories attempt to explain large - scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociological theory is ADV VERB and should never be considered complete . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN grew out of the NOUN of english NOUN and NOUN , PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , who saw NOUN between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the parts of society that PROPN referred to were the social institutions , or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs , such as government , education , family , healthcare , religion , and the economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> durkheim believed that individuals may make up society , but in order to study society , sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social facts are the laws , NOUN , values , religious beliefs , customs , NOUN , NOUN , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life ( durkheim NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each of these social facts serves NUM or more functions within a society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conflict theory <sent_end> <sent_begin> conflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this perspective is a ADJ - level approach most identified with the NOUN of german NOUN and sociologist PROPN marx ( NUM – NUM ) , who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must VERB for social , material , and political resources such as food and housing , employment , education , and NOUN time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which VERB that reality is what humans ADV VERB it to be . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we develop social NOUN based on interactions with others , and those NOUN that last over time are those that have NOUN which are widely agreed - upon or generally accepted by most within the society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people commonly try to understand the NOUN in their world by finding or creating an explanation for an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social scientists may develop a hypothesis for the same reason . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a hypothesis is a ADJ ADJ NOUN about VERB outcomes between NUM or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific NOUN in the social world and allows for NOUN to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN increases the NOUN that what happens to NUM person will happen to all people in a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> researchers also VERB for NOUN , which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB to the crime rate during a full NOUN topic , NOUN of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a hypothesis is an assumption about how NUM or more variables are related ; it makes a ADJ statement about the relationship between those variables . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how NUM form of human behavior VERB another . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach , others operate from an ADJ framework . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while systematic , this approach does n’t follow the hypothesis - NOUN model that VERB to find ADJ results . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a research method , a survey VERB data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and NOUN , often in the form of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the survey is NUM of the most widely used scientific research methods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a random sample , every person in a population has the same chance of being VERB for the study . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the laws of probability , random NOUN represent the population as a whole . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the researcher will end up with a wide range of responses , some of which may be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the benefit of written NOUN , though , is the wealth of material that they provide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a NUM - on - NUM NOUN between the researcher and the subject , and it is a way of conducting NOUN on a topic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are similar to the short - answer questions on NOUN in that the researcher VERB subjects a series of questions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> later , he was VERB for ADV VERB some NOUN of the story and the new PROPN issued an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , PROPN ’s ADJ article still offered ADJ NOUN of the inside NOUN of a “ NOUN NOUN ” company and VERB the NOUN to which a sociologist will go to VERB material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN had conducted a form of study called NOUN observation , in which researchers join people and participate in a group ’s ADJ activities for the purpose of VERB them within that context . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this method VERB researchers experience a specific aspect of social life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment , meaning they VERB relationships to test a hypothesis — a scientific approach . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a researcher will need to do some NOUN to VERB them down and gain access to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB the search through a vast NOUN of materials and avoid VERB time reading ADJ sources , sociologists VERB content analysis , VERB a systematic approach to record and value information VERB from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> or if you are having NOUN with a good NOUN , perhaps that question VERB a more detailed response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these examples are all aspects of culture , which is shared beliefs , values , and practices , that participants must learn . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , we VERB in what situation and context certain behavior is expected , and in which situations perhaps it is not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , as sociologist william PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) described the term , involves a belief or NOUN that one ’s own culture is better than all others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> values are deeply embedded and critical for VERB and VERB a culture ’s beliefs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> beliefs are the NOUN or NOUN that people hold to be true . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals in a society have specific beliefs , but they also share collective values . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN who helps an elderly woman board a NOUN may receive a NOUN and a “ VERB you . ” a business NOUN who VERB profit NOUN may receive a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people VERB certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or NOUN , or by VERB formal actions of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage NOUN to cultural norms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> formal norms are established , written rules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to VERB and serve the most people . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> writing another person ’s words as if they are NUM ’s own has a name — NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the consequences for VERB this NOUN are severe and usually result in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike NOUN , NOUN are norms without any moral NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rather , NOUN direct appropriate behavior in the day - to - day practices and NOUN of a culture . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the united states , for example , the number NUM is associated with bad NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN , however , the number NUM is considered ADJ , since it is VERB similarly to the japanese word for “ death . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN - PROPN hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language , and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hypothesis , which has also been called ADJ relativity , states that language shapes thought ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is just what it sounds like — a smaller cultural group within a larger culture ; people of a NOUN are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN - NOUN societies demonstrate the ADJ NOUN on the environment of the various types of ADJ societies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the basic structure of human society until about NUM years ago , these groups were based around NOUN or tribes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> his primary concern was that the cultural NOUN that held society together was VERB , and people were becoming more divided . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in his book the division of labor in society ( NUM ) , durkheim argued that as society grew more complex , social order made the NOUN from mechanical to organic . ADJ societies , durkheim explained , were held together by mechanical NOUN , a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> societies with mechanical PROPN act in a mechanical NOUN ; things are done mostly because they have always been done that way . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> additionally , marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production — the NOUN — and the NOUN , called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> marx maintained that these NOUN appeared ADV throughout history during times of social revolution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another idea that marx developed is the concept of false consciousness . <sent_end> <sent_begin> false consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs , NOUN , or NOUN of a person are not in the person ’s own best interest . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the symbolic NOUN theory , the third of the NUM most recognized theories of sociology , is based on PROPN ’s early ideas that VERB the NOUN of the individual and how that individual VERB to society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for PROPN , the NOUN of NOUN , NOUN , and the like results in what he referred to as the NOUN NOUN , in which the individual is VERB by institutions and bureaucracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this leads to a sense of “ NOUN of the world , ” a NOUN PROPN used to describe the final condition of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another way of looking at this concept is through NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thomas ’s ADJ thomas NOUN which states , “ if men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences ” ( thomas and thomas NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their ADJ construction of reality rather than by ADJ reality . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their NOUN and role in society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN are VERB — those you do not select , such as NOUN , elderly person , or female . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all we can VERB is behavior , or role performance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> role performance is how a person VERB his or her role . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologist PROPN PROPN presented the idea that a person is like an NOUN on a stage . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> and VERB times and NOUN have continued to increase as new suburbs developed ADV and ADV from city centers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> simultaneously , this ADJ VERB to an ADJ increase in natural resource use , like NOUN , which ADV increased pollution in the form of carbon NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the suburbs became more ADJ and lost their NOUN , those who could VERB it turned to the NOUN , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically VERB by even ADJ families who want more space and have the resources to VERB their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , the suburbs , NOUN , and ADJ areas all combine to form a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the social policy & debate feature illustrates , the suburbs also have their share of ADJ - economic problems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , white flight refers to the NOUN of ADV secure white people from ADV ADJ urban areas and toward the suburbs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this occurred throughout the twentieth century , due to causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by brown v. board of education to the PROPN NOUN of PROPN VERB PROPN ’s PROPN NOUN for PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while you might be more familiar with the NOUN “ global NOUN , ” climate change is the term now used to refer to long - term shifts in temperatures due to human activity and , in particular , the release of NOUN gases into the environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN as a whole is VERB , but the term climate change VERB that the short - term variations in this process can include both higher and lower temperatures , despite the ADJ NOUN toward NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> often , the NOUN are not NOUN , but simply an ADJ part of life for the people who live near ADJ sites such as PROPN , PROPN and PROPN , california . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in many cases , people in these NOUN can be part of a cancer NOUN without VERB the cause . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> where will people live ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> to explore these questions , we turn to NOUN , or the study of populations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most important components that affect the issues above are NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . the NOUN rate of a society is a measure VERB the number of children born . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> changing NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN rates make up the total population NOUN , a NOUN of the ADJ NOUN of a population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN 's ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental NOUN , as ADJ people use up or VERB a number of environmental resources such as water and air . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he advocated for a goal of NUM population growth ( PROPN ) , in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while support for this concept is ADJ , it is still considered a possible solution to global NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> later , george PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) studied the self , a person ’s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order to engage in this process of “ self , ” an individual has to be able to view him or PRON through the eyes of others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most ADV , we have to learn language — whether it ’s the dominant language or NUM common in a NOUN , whether it ’s ADJ or through NOUN — in order to communicate and to think . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as we saw with PROPN , without socialization we literally have no self . nature versus PROPN NOUN VERB that who we are is a result of NOUN — the relationships and VERB that VERB us . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others argue that who we are is based entirely in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just as young children VERB to be NOUN or NOUN , play house , and VERB up , adults also engage in ADJ socialization , the NOUN for future life roles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples would include a NOUN who VERB before marriage or soon - to - be parents who read NOUN care books and VERB their home for the new NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN PROPN NOUN group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN group socialization begins in the ADJ years , such as when NOUN on a NOUN VERB ADJ children the norms about taking NOUN , the rules of a NOUN , or how to shoot a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term group is an ADJ one and can refer to a wide variety of NOUN , from just NUM people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you VERB with another student ) , a NOUN , a ADJ NOUN of NOUN , or people who work together or share a hobby . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in short , the term refers to any collection of at least NUM people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is ADV aligned with the group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> types of groups <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologist charles PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) suggested that groups can ADV be divided into NUM categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN that we belong in an elite or select group is a ADJ one , while the NOUN of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be VERB in a different way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologist william PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) developed the concepts of in - group and out - group to explain this phenomenon ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in short , an in - group is the group that an individual VERB she VERB to , and she VERB it to be an integral part of who she is . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after all , how well could soldiers function in a NOUN if they had no idea whom to VERB to or if different people were VERB out NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> other secondary groups , like a workplace or a NOUN , also have formal leaders , but the NOUN and functions of leadership can vary significantly . leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an instrumental leader is NUM who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with VERB set tasks . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> former secretary of state hillary clinton 's experiences provide an example of the way society VERB to a high - NOUN woman who is an instrumental leader . <sent_end> <sent_begin> despite the NOUN , PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of ADJ and instrumental leadership . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to these leadership functions , there are NUM different leadership NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and NOUN , it VERB group NOUN and a lack of progress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the name suggests , ADJ leaders issue NOUN and VERB tasks . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these may include prison or a NOUN center . <sent_end> <sent_begin> symbolic NOUN PROPN PROPN states that most ADJ organizations are total institutions ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a total institution is NUM in which NOUN or military soldiers live a controlled NOUN and in which total NOUN takes place . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy , each individual has a specialized task to perform . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , psychology NOUN VERB psychology , but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this results in an ADJ organization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN frequently VERB that stores like PROPN care little about individuals , other businesses , and the community at large . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are , in theory at least , NOUN , meaning that NOUN and NOUN is based on VERB and VERB skills , rather than on NOUN or random choice . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order to get into a ADJ college , you need to perform well on the PROPN and have an ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> and what is the relationship between deviance and crime ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to sociologist william PROPN PROPN , deviance is a NOUN of established ADJ , cultural , or social norms , whether NOUN , NOUN , or VERB law ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it can be as minor as VERB your NOUN in public or as major as VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> think of social order as an employee NOUN and social control as a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a worker VERB a workplace NOUN , the NOUN steps in to enforce the rules ; when an employee is doing an ADV good job at following the rules , the NOUN may VERB or promote the employee . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the means of VERB rules are known as sanctions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sanctions can be positive as well as negative . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although NOUN , a form of social deviance , may be illegal , there are no laws VERB the proper way to VERB your NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that does n’t mean VERB your NOUN in public VERB n’t be VERB ; instead , you will VERB ADJ sanctions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ sanctions VERB in face - to - face social interactions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> developed by researchers at the university of chicago in the NOUN and 1930s , social NOUN theory VERB that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social NOUN and the absence of social control . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an individual who VERB up in a poor NOUN with high rates of drug use , violence , ADJ NOUN , and VERB NOUN is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy NOUN with a good school system and families who are involved ADV in the community . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of german NOUN , economist , and social scientist PROPN marx . <sent_end> <sent_begin> marx believed that the general population was divided into NUM groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologist PROPN PROPN expanded on the concepts of NOUN theory and identified NUM types of deviance that affect identity formation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> primary deviance is a NOUN of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a ADJ act , but receiving a VERB NOUN generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since NOUN was a young field , he VERB on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his NOUN established ADJ association theory , which suggested that individuals learn ADJ behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of ADJ socialization processes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in modern u.s. society , crimes are classified as NUM of NUM types based on their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> violent crimes ( also known as “ crimes against a person ” ) are based on the use of force or the threat of force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ NOUN fall under this category . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or NOUN committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an often VERB category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - NOUN workers in a business environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN trading , and identity NOUN are all types of corporate crime . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> due to these issues , the u.s. bureau of justice statistics VERB a separate self - report study known as the national crime PROPN report ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a self - report study is a collection of data VERB using voluntary response methods , such as NOUN or NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> self - report data are VERB each year , VERB approximately NUM people in the united states about the frequency and types of crime they VERB experienced in their daily lives ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN a crime has been committed and a NOUN has been identified by the police , the case goes to court . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first is ADJ class - based access to technology in the form of the ADJ divide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ divide has led to the second form , a knowledge gap , which is , as it sounds , an ADJ and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> simply put , students in well - funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in ADV funded schools . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to the ADJ perspective , health is ADJ to the stability of the society , and therefore NOUN is a VERB form of deviance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) was the first to discuss this in terms of the ADJ role : patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the ADJ and for those who take care of them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , VERB focus on the specific NOUN and causes people VERB to illness . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term NOUN of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ ADJ ” behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a related process is NOUN , in which “ ADJ ” behavior is VERB again . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the u.s. PROPN current population survey of NUM shows that NUM percent of people in the united states have no health insurance at all . <sent_end> <sent_begin> equally ADJ , a study by the PROPN fund shows that in NUM , NUM NUM adults were either ADJ or ADJ ; that is , people who pay at least NUM percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or , for low - income adults , those whose medical NOUN or NOUN are at least NUM percent of their income ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN study further VERB that while NOUN has ADV been an issue that low - income families faced , today it is VERB middle - income families more and more . why are so many people ADJ or ADJ ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the best example of ADJ NOUN is in great britain , where the national health system ( PROPN ) gives free healthcare to all its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and despite some u.s. citizens ’ NOUN - NOUN reaction to any healthcare changes that NOUN of NOUN , the united states has NUM VERB system with the PROPN health administration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is important to distinguish between ADJ NOUN , in which the government VERB the healthcare system , and universal healthcare , which is simply a system that guarantees healthcare coverage for everyone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> germany , PROPN , and canada all have universal healthcare . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN and her research NOUN ( NUM ) state that “ NUM of the ADJ and most consistent NOUN of a person 's NOUN and NOUN experience is that person 's ADJ status ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this finding VERB across all diseases with few NOUN , continues throughout the entire NOUN , and extends across numerous risk factors for disease . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN of disease . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is important to remember that economics are only part of the PROPN picture ; research suggests that education also plays an important role . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and link ( NUM ) note that many behavior - influenced diseases like lung cancer ( from NOUN ) , ADJ NOUN disease ( from poor eating and exercise NOUN ) , and PROPN initially were widespread across PROPN groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of NOUN and NOUN that last for months at a time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> anxiety disorders include ADJ ADJ disorder ( PROPN ) , panic disorders , ADJ stress disorder ( PROPN ) , and both social and specific NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second most common mental disorders in the united states are mood disorders ; roughly NUM percent of u.s. adults are likely to be affected ADJ , while NUM percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( national institute of mental health NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> major mood disorders are depression , ADJ disorder , and ADJ disorder . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the world health organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe NOUN that ’s important to the sociological perspective . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they use the term NOUN to describe the physical NOUN , while VERB the term NOUN to refer to the social NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before the passage of the americans with PROPN act ( PROPN ) in NUM , people in the united states with NOUN were often VERB from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social NOUN is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social NOUN can VERB how social problems are connected to the health of different populations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN may keep people from seeking help for their illness , making it ADJ than it needs to be . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are those that are VERB or ADJ by some medical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> disorders like NOUN or ADJ NOUN syndrome may be either true NOUN or only in the patients ’ NOUN , depending on the opinion of the medical NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these are granted for the NOUN or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant NOUN to existing NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second type of patent is a design patent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> commonly VERB in NOUN and industrial design , this means someone has VERB a new and original design for a VERB product . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> new media VERB all ADJ forms of information exchange . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these include social NOUN sites , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but the numbers are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> media NOUN is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this creates an NOUN in which a few firms VERB the media NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such a ADV - VERB ADJ is not always to our benefit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some sociologists VERB that this level of media exposure leads to NOUN NOUN , a result in which people are too ADJ with media input to really care about the issue , so their involvement becomes defined by awareness instead of by action ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and NOUN is PROPN , the application to , and NOUN of , NOUN ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research on NOUN runs the NOUN from the ADJ use of NOUN by women living in iraq during the second PROPN war ( PROPN NUM ) to an NOUN of the PROPN PROPN web site ( NOUN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , race , gender , and other factors have always VERB a role in the reality of success . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more recently , the increased NOUN — or VERB a job or set of jobs to an outside source — of VERB jobs to developing nations has greatly VERB the number of high - paying , often ADJ , blue - NOUN positions available . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a similar problem has VERB in the white - NOUN NOUN , with many low - level ADJ and support positions also being VERB , as VERB by the international ADJ - support call centers in PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , canada . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are usually found in pairs and the number of NOUN varies with the species of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are ADJ , which increases their surface area , and they are VERB with NOUN for NOUN and maintenance of ADJ balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN work ADV with specialized glands in the wall of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mammals , including humans , produce NOUN , whereas NOUN and many terrestrial NOUN produce NOUN acid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> animals that secrete NOUN as the primary ADJ waste material are called ADJ animals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both NOUN and ADJ cells VERB pathogens and cellular NOUN through NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is also a ADJ NOUN that VERB and VERB pathogens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , shown in [ link ] , are the most ADJ NOUN of the immune system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> t cells and b cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> t cells are lymphocytes that mature in the NOUN gland , and b cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN cells identify intracellular NOUN , especially from viruses , by the VERB expression of major NOUN class ( PROPN ) i molecules on the surface of infected cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN proteins perform several functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the proteins serve as a NOUN to indicate the presence of a pathogen to ADJ cells , such as NOUN and b cells , and VERB NOUN ; this process is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> certain NOUN proteins can combine to form attack NOUN that open NOUN in ADJ cell membranes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an antigen is a foreign or “ non - self ” NOUN that VERB with cells of the immune system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> not all NOUN will VERB a response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> any individual may possess a population of t and b cells that together express a near ADJ variety of antigen receptors that are capable of VERB ADV any VERB pathogen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> t and b cells are activated when they recognize small components of NOUN , called NOUN , presented by PROPN , illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that recognition occurs at a specific NOUN rather than on the entire antigen ; for this reason , NOUN are known as “ ADJ NOUN . ” in the absence of information from NOUN , t and b cells remain ADJ , or ADJ , and are unable to VERB an immune response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when stimulated by the PROPN pathway , ADJ b cells VERB into NOUN - VERB plasma cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a plasma cell is an immune cell that NOUN NOUN ; these cells arise from b cells that were stimulated by NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similar to t cells , ADJ b cells initially are VERB in thousands of b cell receptors ( PROPN ) , which are membrane - bound forms of PROPN ( NOUN , or an NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN is formed by NOUN - associated ADJ tissue , which functions ADV of the ADJ immune system , and which has its own innate and adaptive components . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - associated ADJ tissue ( NOUN ) , illustrated in [ link ] , is a collection of ADJ tissue that VERB with ADJ tissue lining the NOUN throughout the body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the combined result of PROPN cells is to prevent ADJ NOUN and NOUN in ADJ tissue NOUN and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to VERB immune NOUN of ADJ NOUN , other NOUN of PROPN cells are involved in the NOUN of the ADJ response , which is an ADJ immune response to host cells or self - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another PROPN class VERB immune responses to ADJ pathogens after the infection has VERB to VERB host cell damage induced by NOUN and cell NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term NOUN describes binding by NOUN classes that are secreted as VERB , ADJ structures ( such as PROPN and PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although NOUN measures the strength of binding , just as NOUN does , the NOUN is not simply the sum of the NOUN of the NOUN in a NOUN structure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN - NOUN - NOUN system , illustrated in [ link ] VERB through several steps to produce NOUN ii , which acts to VERB blood pressure and volume . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( secreted by a part of the ADJ complex ) is produced by the ADJ cells of the ADJ and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it also triggers the release of the NOUN NOUN from the adrenal cortex , which in turn stimulates the renal NOUN to VERB more sodium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ii also triggers the release of anti - ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) from the hypothalamus , leading to water NOUN in the kidneys . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it acts directly on the NOUN and decreases ADJ NOUN rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , or NOUN at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or NOUN cells to gain a NOUN and VERB or VERB to high enough levels that the immune system becomes ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the failure , NOUN , or VERB in the response of the immune system , which may be acquired or inherited . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens ( such as PROPN ) , chemical exposure ( including certain medical NOUN ) , NOUN , or ADV by extreme stress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is a type of NOUN to self NOUN that affects approximately NUM percent of the population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most types of NOUN involve the ADJ immune response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN of the body into NUM parts with subsequent NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the animal is capable of NOUN , and the part is big enough , a separate individual will VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN the young develop within the female , receiving NOUN from the mother ’s blood through a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the offspring develops in the female and is born ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is a mixture of sperm and ADJ NOUN NOUN ( about NUM percent of the total ) and fluids from ADJ glands that contribute most of the NOUN ’s volume . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sperm are haploid cells , consisting of a NOUN as a tail , a NOUN that contains the cell ’s energy - producing mitochondria , and a head that contains the genetic material . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN - shaped NOUN gland surrounds the NOUN , the connection to the ADJ bladder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it has a series of short NOUN that directly VERB to the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is a structure with NOUN tissue that contains a large number of sensory NOUN and serves as a source of NOUN during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN PROPN are a pair of ADJ NOUN of tissue that run posterior from the PROPN PROPN and VERB the other components of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN VERB from the same tissue that produces the NOUN in a male . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in both NOUN , the hypothalamus VERB and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus VERB a NOUN - releasing hormone ( PROPN ) to the anterior pituitary . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this causes the release of NOUN stimulating hormone ( PROPN ) and ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in addition , NOUN and NOUN are released from the developing NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the reproductive hormone in females that VERB in ADJ NOUN , NOUN , and calcium NOUN ; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these include NOUN development , VERB of the NOUN , and a shorter period necessary for bone NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just prior to the middle of the cycle ( approximately day NUM ) , the high level of NOUN causes NOUN and especially PROPN to rise rapidly , then fall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN in PROPN causes NOUN : the most mature NOUN , like that shown in [ link ] , NOUN and releases its egg . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN that did not VERB ADJ and their eggs are lost . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of NOUN called the X NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a sperm binds to the X NOUN , a series of ADJ events , called the ADJ reactions , take place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ mammals , the NOUN contains digestive enzymes that VERB the NOUN of the NOUN matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane , as illustrated in [ link ] b . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in mammals , the NOUN forms the NOUN in the next stage of development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here the cells in the NOUN VERB themselves in NUM layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the length of time of NOUN varies among animals , but is very similar among the great NOUN : human NOUN is NUM days , while NOUN NOUN is NUM days , a NOUN ’s is NUM days , and NOUN NOUN is NUM days long . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN has a NUM - day NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of a NOUN comes under the terms NOUN or birth control . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV speaking , NOUN refers to preventing the sperm and egg from VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both terms are , however , frequently used ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN VERB a series of cell movements where it VERB up and forms a tube called the ADJ tube , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in further development , the ADJ tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a population is a group of VERB organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( organisms that are all members of the same species are called NOUN . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> a population is identified , in part , by where it lives , and its area of population may have natural or ADJ NOUN : natural NOUN might be NOUN , NOUN , or NOUN , while examples of ADJ NOUN include VERB NOUN , ADJ structures , or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many ADJ forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ factors influence the distribution of NOUN : large areas of land with similar climate , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is little species diversity , low net primary productivity , and low ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the soils of the ADJ NOUN may remain in a ADV ADJ state referred to as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN makes it impossible for roots to VERB deep into the soil and VERB the decay of organic matter , which VERB the release of nutrients from organic matter . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the NOUN to the ADJ parts of the ocean floor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> within the ADJ realm is the ADJ zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can VERB ( approximately NUM m or NUM NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at NOUN greater than NUM m , light can not VERB ; thus , this is referred to as the ADJ zone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ zone ( [ link ] ) extends from the ADJ zone to NOUN of about NUM m ( or NUM NOUN ) at the NOUN of the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since light can VERB this depth , photosynthesis can occur in the ADJ zone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ part of the ocean is the NOUN zone , which is at NOUN of NUM m or greater . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN zone ( [ link ] ) is very cold and has very high pressure , high oxygen content , and low NOUN content . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because of this , they are determining factors in the amount of ADJ growth in NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when there is a large input of nitrogen and NOUN ( from NOUN and NOUN from VERB NOUN and NOUN , for example ) , the growth of algae NOUN , resulting in a large NOUN of algae called an ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) can become so extensive that they reduce light NOUN in water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are different from NOUN because NOUN are ADJ bodies of water whereas NOUN vary in depth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN consists of NOUN plants that are VERB in the soil but have portions of leaves , stems , and flowers VERB above the water ’s surface . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are several types of NOUN including NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> climate does not address the amount of NOUN that VERB on NUM particular day in a NOUN or the ADJ - than - average temperatures that occurred on NUM day . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , NOUN refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN are usually made for ADJ cycles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this occurred in NUM when NOUN in PROPN VERB and caused the release of large NOUN of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this led to NOUN - effect NOUN , a global phenomenon that occurs when NOUN , NOUN , or other VERB particles block out sunlight and VERB lower global temperatures as a result ; NOUN - effect NOUN usually extends for NUM or more years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in europe and north america , NOUN - effect NOUN produced some of the lowest average NOUN temperatures on record in NUM and NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another source of NOUN is the NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are ADJ NOUN of NOUN and NOUN found at the bottom of the ocean . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when water VERB , these NOUN of NOUN NOUN and NOUN is released . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist , and how closely associated they are with each other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> within a particular NOUN , a population can be characterized by its population size ( n ) , the total number of individuals , and its population density , the number of individuals within a specific area or volume . <sent_end> <sent_begin> population size and density are the NUM main characteristics used to describe and understand populations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in addition to measuring simple density , further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> species NOUN patterns ( or distribution patterns ) show the ADJ relationship between members of a population within a NOUN at a particular point in time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart , and what patterns are ADJ when they are VERB apart . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , VERB the growth rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , when VERB the growth rate of a population , the death rate ( d ) ( number organisms that die during a particular time NOUN ) is VERB from the birth rate ( b ) ( number organisms that are born during that NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is shown in the following formula : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the real world , ADJ variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better VERB to their environment than others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed ADJ competition ( X = “ within ” ; NOUN = “ species ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity — resources are ADJ and all individuals can obtain what they need . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ NOUN , multiple species share the same NOUN NOUN , but all of them actually have NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a variety of ADV - VERB NOUN with similar NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and VERB nutrients from it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this relationship , the NOUN benefits , but the organism being VERB upon , the host is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the area in question could be a NOUN , a NOUN , or the entire NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> species NOUN is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> species NOUN varies across the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN species is NUM whose presence is key to VERB NOUN within an ecosystem and to VERB an ADJ community ’s structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ sea NOUN , PROPN NOUN , of the ADJ united states is a PROPN species ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the big island , approximately NUM NOUN of land is added each year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , NOUN and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain ADJ plants and NOUN with few soil requirements , known as NOUN species ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these species help to further break down the NOUN rich NOUN into soil where other , less ADJ species will grow and eventually VERB the NOUN species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary NOUN for such changes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> innate or ADJ behaviors rely on response to stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ example of this is a ADJ action , an ADJ and rapid response to stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to test the “ NOUN - NOUN ” NOUN , a NOUN VERB the ADJ NOUN below the NOUN with a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a fixed action pattern is a series of movements VERB by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed , the pattern goes on to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of such a behavior occurs in the NUM - VERB NOUN , a small ADJ fish ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> communication within a species <sent_end> <sent_begin> animals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of this is seen in the NUM - VERB NOUN , where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become ADJ and signals females to mate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN are seen in birds and some fish . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are designed to attract a NOUN away from the NOUN that contains their young . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ systems , NUM male and NUM female are VERB for at least NUM NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some animals , such as the ADJ NOUN , these NOUN can last much longer , even a lifetime . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is a simple form of learning in which an animal VERB VERB to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is a form of non - ADJ learning , as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in classical conditioning , a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with , the conditioned stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the response to the original , ADJ stimulus is called the ADJ response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a species ’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime , such as how resources are VERB for growth , maintenance , and reproduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> life history traits affect the life NOUN of an organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> single versus multiple reproductive PROPN life history traits , such as NOUN , NOUN of reproduction , and parental care , can be VERB together into general strategies that are used by multiple species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs when a species VERB only once during its lifetime and then VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event , VERB their health to the point that they do not survive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nature VERB population growth in a variety of ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are VERB into density - dependent factors , in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and NOUN , and density - independent factors , which influence NOUN in a population regardless of population density . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that in the former , the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , the theory VERB the age - specific NOUN of the populations which scientists now know is very important . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new NOUN - based models of life history evolution have been developed which VERB many ADJ concepts included in X and k - selection theory as well as population age structure and NOUN factors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , NUM NOUN are used to measure changes in ecosystems : resistance and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in NOUN of disturbances is called resistance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the speed at which an ecosystem VERB equilibrium after being VERB , called its NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is a single path through the chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each organism in a food chain VERB what is called a ADJ level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> depending on their role as producers or consumers , species or groups of species can be VERB to various ADJ levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the organisms that consume the primary producers are NOUN : the primary consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary consumers are usually NOUN that eat the primary consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ consumers are NOUN that eat other NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ model — which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex ADJ relationships with each other and with the environment — is a more accurate and ADJ model for ecosystems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a food web is a ADJ representation of a ADJ , non - linear web of primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment ( disturbances ) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM basic types of ecosystem NOUN are ADV used in research and ecosystem management : a ADJ model , an ADJ model , and a NOUN model . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow NOUN to show interactions of different NOUN of the living and VERB components of the ecosystem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem ; however , its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available , such as in those associated with dark NOUN or NOUN NOUN at the bottom of the ocean ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many NOUN in ADJ NOUN use hydrogen NOUN ( NOUN ) , which is released from the NOUN as a source of chemical energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this ecosystem , the total energy VERB by the primary producers ( ADJ primary productivity ) was shown to be NUM PROPN / m2 / NOUN . because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions ( like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss ) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms ’ respiration and heat loss . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next ADJ level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next ADJ level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present ADJ level after accounting for the energy lost due to ADJ NOUN of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ processes , such as NOUN , NOUN , water NOUN , and the NOUN of the ADJ NOUN , all play a role in this NOUN of materials . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because NOUN and NOUN have major roles in the study of this process , the NOUN of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a ADJ cycle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fossil NOUN are considered a non - ADJ resource because their use far VERB their rate of formation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a non - ADJ resource , such as fossil NOUN , is either VERB very ADV or not at all . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land ADP the surface of the ocean ) by the NOUN of NOUN and other ADJ systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a dead zone is an area within a ADJ or marine ecosystem where large areas are VERB of their normal NOUN and NOUN ; these zones can be caused by NOUN , oil NOUN , VERB of ADJ chemicals , and other human activities . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the number of dead zones has been increasing for several years , and more than NUM of these zones were present as of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> traditionally , NOUN have measured NOUN , a general term for the variety present in the NOUN , by taking into account both the number of species and their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> genetic diversity is NUM of those ADJ concepts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> genetic diversity or variation is the ADJ material for NOUN in a species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all of these species were found only in lake PROPN ; therefore , the NUM species of NOUN were ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ species are found in only NUM location . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN with highly restricted NOUN are particularly ADJ to extinction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN extinction is NUM of the ADJ NOUN , and a recent NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is well known that the north american , and to some degree ADJ , NOUN , or large animals , VERB toward the end of the last NOUN period . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the extinction appears to have VERB in a relatively restricted time period of NUM – NUM years ago . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the ADJ uses of plants growing in their area . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most plants produce secondary plant compounds , which are NOUN used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them , but some of which also work as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for centuries in europe , older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was VERB in NOUN — books that identified plants and their uses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ species are species that have been ADV or ADV introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such NOUN likely occur frequently as natural phenomena . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the technology of molecular NOUN and data processing and storage are VERB to the point where VERB the NOUN ’s species in an ADJ way is close to ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dna NOUN is NUM molecular genetic method , which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a ADJ gene present in NOUN , VERB the plants , to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> plants may be VERB using a combination of NOUN genes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> warren PROPN was the first president to regularly give NOUN over the radio . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president PROPN hoover used radio as well , mainly to VERB government programs on aid and unemployment relief . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ PROPN hoover : radio address to the nation on unemployment relief , ” the american presidency project , NUM october NUM , PROPN / PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet it was franklin d. roosevelt who became famous for VERB the political power of radio . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on entering office in march NUM , president roosevelt needed to VERB public NOUN about the economy and prevent people from VERB their money from the banks . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> stations VERB their own NOUN NOUN , signal NOUN , and frequencies , which sometimes VERB with NUM another or with the military , leading to NOUN problems for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the radio act ( NUM ) created the federal radio commission ( PROPN ) , which made the first effort to set standards , frequencies , and NOUN stations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the commission was under ADJ pressure from congress , however , and had little authority . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> television was also useful to combat NOUN and NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> republican vice presidential candidate richard nixon used a VERB speech in NUM to address NOUN that he had taken money from a political campaign fund ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nixon laid out his NOUN , investments , and NOUN and ended by VERB that the only election NOUN the family had received was a PROPN PROPN the children named PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ the PROPN speech after NUM years , ” the PROPN , NUM september NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the “ PROPN speech ” was VERB more for VERB nixon than for VERB he had not taken money from the campaign account . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN - take - all systems of VERB candidates to office , which exist in several countries other than the united states , require that the NOUN receive either the majority of votes or a NOUN of the votes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> u.s. elections are based on NOUN voting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes VERB , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( NUM percent or greater ) of the total votes VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under this model of proportional representation , legislative NOUN are VERB to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , any given election can have multiple NOUN , and voters who might prefer a smaller party over a major one have a chance to be represented in government ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> SCONJ the existence of the electoral college , political scientist PROPN w. PROPN has also suggested that the relative NOUN of the united states and the relative NOUN of its citizens have VERB the formation of “ large VERB groups ” that might give support to third parties . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> since VERB elections is the first goal of the political party , it makes sense that the formal party organization VERB the local - state - federal structure of the u.s. political system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the lowest level of party organization is ADV the NOUN , many of the ADJ responsibilities for local elections fall upon the county - level organization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the county - level organization is in many ways the NOUN of the party system , especially around election time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , for example , only NUM - third of the eligible voters in new PROPN VERB in the state ’s primary , NUM of the ADJ and thus most important in the nation ; however , NUM percent of eligible voters in the state VERB in the general election in november NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ voter PROPN , ” PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people may see or read an ADJ story about the NOUN of the state committees or convention but pay little attention . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but the national NOUN , organized and VERB by the national - level party , can VERB the national discussion for several weeks in late NOUN , a time when the major media NOUN are often VERB for news . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are the definition of a media NOUN at which high - VERB politicians , party NOUN , and sometimes NOUN , such as NOUN / director PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) , along with individuals many consider to be the future leaders of the party are brought before the public so the party can make its best case for being the NUM to direct the future of the country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ PROPN , the PROPN PROPN , and the speech everyone ’s VERB about , ” NUM august NUM , X ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> national party NOUN VERB in the formal nomination of the party NOUN for the NOUN of president and vice president , and they VERB the official beginning of the presidential competition between the NUM parties . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> leaders serve as party NOUN and are the highest - VERB members of the party in each chamber of congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the party NOUN VERB that members are present when a piece of legislation is to be VERB on and VERB them how to vote . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is the second - highest VERB member of the party in each chamber . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their NOUN to VERB party members who VERB on a particular vote . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , a member of the minority party must ADV work with the opposition on some issues in order to VERB any of his or her NOUN ’s goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is especially the case in the senate , which is a ADJ - majority institution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the past NUM years have brought a dramatic change in the relationship between the NUM parties as fewer conservative democrats and liberal republicans have been elected to office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as political NOUN , or individuals with NOUN in the middle of the ADJ spectrum , leave the political parties at all levels , the parties have VERB ADV apart ADV , a result called party polarization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , at least ADV and in government , republicans and democrats have become increasingly ADJ from NUM another ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps the ADJ sign of congress ’ NOUN is that the threat of government NOUN has become a constant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occur when congress and the president are unable to VERB and appropriate funds before the current budget runs out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a final possible cause for polarization is the increasing NOUN of NOUN , or the NOUN of legislative NOUN in an attempt to favor a particular candidate ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the NOUN NOUN , the more moderate or ADJ a voting district , the more moderate the NOUN ’s behavior once in office . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> legislators VERB the courts to VERB the popular NOUN and end the operation of the NOUN commission . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the u.s. supreme court upheld the authority of the independent commission in a NUM – NUM decision VERB arizona state legislature v. arizona independent PROPN commission ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> arizona state legislature v. arizona independent PROPN commission , NUM PROPN PROPN .

<sent_begin> in somewhat of a VERB NOUN in the general election stage of the process , by the presidential election of NUM , many states were using popular elections to choose their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this became important in that election when andrew jackson won the popular vote and the largest number of NOUN , but the presidency was given to john PROPN adams instead . <sent_end> <sent_begin> out of the NOUN of jackson ’s supporters emerged a powerful NUM - party system that took control of the selection process . daniel PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> indeed , until the twentieth century , many presidents had little to do with the NOUN of their running mate at the VERB convention . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the office was seen as a form of political NOUN , and that motivated republicans to name PROPN roosevelt as william PROPN ’s running mate in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the strategy was to get the ADJ NOUN out of the way while still taking advantage of his NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but in the 1970s , starting with PROPN PROPN , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the VERB NOUN , VERB them in charge of increasingly important issues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes , as in the case of bill clinton and al PROPN , the NOUN appeared to be smooth if not always ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of george w. bush and his very experienced vice president PROPN PROPN , NOUN VERB whether the vice president might have VERB too much influence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first act VERB by the new president — the NOUN of an ADJ address — can do much to set the tone for what is intended to follow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while such an address may be an exercise in ADJ NOUN , it also allows the president to set ADP NOUN within the ADJ vision of what he or she VERB to do . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the concept of going public involves the president VERB a major television address in the NOUN that americans VERB the address will be VERB to contact their house and senate member and that such public pressure will result in the legislators supporting the president on a major piece of legislation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> technological NOUN have made it more efficient for presidents to take their NOUN directly to the people than was the case before mass media ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it matters because the support of farmers in high - income countries is ADJ to the NOUN of farmers in low - income countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even when their climate and land are well - VERB to products like cotton , NOUN , sugar , or NOUN , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> u.s. producers obtain a higher price so they sell a larger quantity of sugar . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the effects of a NOUN on producers and consumers in the united states can be measured using NUM concepts developed in demand , supply , and efficiency : consumer surplus and producer surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sugar supply and demand when there is free trade , the equilibrium is at point a . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN refers to selling goods below their cost of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> anti - ADJ laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by VERB tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since NOUN is not allowed under the rules of the world trade organization ( PROPN ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of VERB goods can VERB a NOUN with the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in general , high - income countries such as the united states , canada , PROPN , and the nations of the european union have relatively strict environmental standards . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , NOUN and low - income countries like brazil , PROPN , PROPN , and china have lower environmental standards . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument ADV is that almost any product can be VERB by NOUN and politicians as ADJ to national security . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the united states became ADJ that it was VERB half of the NOUN required for military NOUN , so it declared NOUN and NOUN to be “ ADJ materials ” and began to give NOUN to NOUN and NOUN farmers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are different types of economic integration across the NOUN , VERB from free trade agreements , in which participants allow each other ’s imports without tariffs or NOUN , to common markets , in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group , to full economic unions , in which , in addition to a common market , monetary and fiscal policies are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many nations belong both to the world trade organization and to ADJ trading agreements . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> a bar graph uses the height of different NOUN to compare quantities . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] VERB the NUM most ADJ countries in the world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , points a and b VERB on the same indifference curve INTJ , which means that they provide PROPN with the same level of utility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the marginal utility that PROPN would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from NUM to NUM must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of NOUN was cut from NUM to NUM that her overall utility remains ADJ between points a and b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of NOUN , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade NUM good for another so that utility will remain the same . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this information provides the basis for the budget line shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> along with the budget line are shown the NUM indifference curves from [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is PROPN ’s utility - VERB choice ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if NOUN get ADJ , people fire up their VERB NOUN and VERB off on other NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the income effect refers to how a change in the price of a good VERB the effective buying power of NUM ’s income . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the price of a good that you have been buying falls , then in effect your buying power has VERB — you are able to purchase more goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as explained in financial markets , the prices of NOUN and bonds VERB on future events . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make , including both payments of interest and the NOUN of the face value of the bond . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all sales of the final goods and services that make up gdp will eventually end up as income for workers , for NOUN , and for investors and owners of firms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sum of all the income received for VERB resources to gdp is called national income ( y ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at some points in the discussion that follows , it will be useful to refer to real gdp as “ national income . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> both NOUN are measured in real ( inflation - adjusted ) terms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the final NOUN of the keynesian cross or expenditure - output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule , which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the aggregate expenditure line with the ADJ line — at point PROPN in [ link ] — will show the equilibrium for the economy , because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( exactly how a situation of NUM income and negative savings would work in practice is not important , because even low - income societies are not literally at NUM income , so the point is ADJ . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> this relationship between income and consumption , illustrated in [ link ] and [ link ] , is called the consumption function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all the components of aggregate demand — consumption , investment , government spending , and the trade balance — are now in place to build the keynesian cross diagram . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] VERB up an aggregate expenditure function , based on the ADJ NOUN of c , i , g , x , and m that have been used throughout this NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the meaning of “ equilibrium ” remains the same ; that is , equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to understand why the point of NOUN between the aggregate expenditure function and the ADJ line is a macroeconomic equilibrium , consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point e , say point h in [ link ] , where output is higher than the equilibrium . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this way , the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called the ADJ effect : an initial increase in spending , cycles ADV through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the equilibrium price is $ NUM and the equilibrium quantity is NUM NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to see the benefits to consumers , look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this portion of the demand curve shows that at least some NOUN would have been willing to pay more than $ NUM for a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled g — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] , social surplus would be shown as the area f + g . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the new consumer surplus is g , and the new producer surplus is h + i . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in effect , the price floor causes the area h to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus , but also causes a ADJ loss of PROPN + k . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity , acts or statements that are extremely ADJ under current societal standards . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; supreme court justice PROPN PROPN famously said of obscenity , having VERB NOUN in the supreme court building , “ i know it when i see it . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently VERB as being ADJ , including works by noted NOUN such as james PROPN and henry miller , although today it is rare for the courts to VERB obscenity charges for written material alone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the supreme court established the miller test for VERB whether something is ADJ : “ ( a ) whether the average person , VERB ADJ community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , NOUN to the ADJ interest , ( b ) whether the work VERB or describes , in a ADV ADJ way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the ADJ state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , VERB ADJ ADJ , ADJ , political , or scientific value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ” miller v. california , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the application of this standard has at times been ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , the courts have ruled that , although public school officials are government NOUN , the first amendment freedom of expression rights of children VERB public schools are somewhat limited . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in particular , in PROPN v. PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) and PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) , the supreme court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates “ substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. PROPN PROPN independent community school district , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> or is “ ADV related to ADJ ADJ concerns . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN school district et al . <sent_end> <sent_begin> v. PROPN et al . , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the content of school - VERB activities like school newspapers and NOUN delivered by students can be controlled , either for the purposes of VERB students in proper adult behavior or to VERB conflict between students . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before the civil war , this would have been a nearly ADJ distinction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in most states at that time , white males of military age were considered part of the NOUN , ADJ to be called for service to put down NOUN or NOUN , and the right “ to keep and bear arms ” was considered a common - law right inherited from english law that VERB the federal and state NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the constitution was not seen as a NOUN on state power , and since the states expected all able - ADJ free men to keep arms as a matter of course , what gun control there was mostly VERB around VERB slaves ( and their ADJ NOUN ) did n’t have NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , in NUM , in a ADJ NUM – NUM decision on district of PROPN v. PROPN , the supreme court found that at least some gun control laws did VERB the second amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , at least in some circumstances — in particular , “ for traditionally ADJ purposes , such as self - defense within the home . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> district of PROPN et NOUN v. PROPN , NUM us NUM ( NUM ) , NOUN NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the district of PROPN is not a state , this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and ADJ governments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fourth amendment VERB at the NOUN between general individual freedoms and the rights of those VERB of crimes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we saw earlier that perhaps it VERB james madison ’s broader concern about VERB an NOUN of privacy from government NOUN at home . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what happens if the police conduct an illegal search or NOUN without a NOUN and find evidence of a crime ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NUM supreme court case PROPN v. PROPN , the court decided that evidence obtained without a NOUN that did n’t fall under NUM of the NOUN mentioned above could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial , giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the ADJ rule , which was first established in NUM on a federal level in weeks v. united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) ; weeks v. united states , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ rule does n’t just apply to evidence found or to items or people VERB without a NOUN ( or falling under an exception noted above ) ; it also VERB to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fifth amendment also protects individuals against double NOUN , a process that subjects a NOUN to NOUN ADV for the same criminal act . <sent_end> <sent_begin> no one who has been VERB ( found not ADJ ) of a crime can be VERB again for that crime . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , in a criminal trial , if someone does not VERB in his or her own defense , the NOUN can not use that failure to VERB as evidence of NOUN or VERB that an ADJ person would VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this provision became embedded in the public consciousness following the supreme court ’s NUM ruling in PROPN v. arizona , ADV NOUN were required to be VERB of their most important rights , including the right against self - NOUN , before being VERB in police NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. arizona , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , ADJ to some media NOUN of the PROPN NOUN , law enforcement officials do not necessarily have to VERB NOUN of their rights before they are VERB in situations where they are free to leave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> and , while we traditionally think of property owners as relatively well - off people whose rights do n’t necessarily need protecting since they can VERB for themselves in the political system , frequently these cases NOUN ADJ and middle - class NOUN against ADJ corporations or NOUN with the ear of city and state officials . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a ADJ NUM case , PROPN v. city of new PROPN , the supreme court VERB with ADJ officials taking homes in a middle - class NOUN to obtain land for a large ADJ company ’s corporate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN et NOUN v. city of new PROPN et al . , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the case led to a public NOUN against the use of ADJ NOUN and legal changes in many states , making it ADV for cities to take property from NUM private party and give it to another for economic NOUN purposes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is a payment of money that allows a person VERB of a crime to be freed VERB trial ; if you “ make NOUN ” in a case and do not show up for your trial , you will VERB the money you paid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since many people can not VERB to pay NOUN directly , they may instead get a NOUN bond , which allows them to pay a NOUN of the money ( typically NUM percent ) to a person who VERB bonds and who pays the full NOUN amount . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( in most states , the bond seller makes money because the NOUN does not get back the money for the bond , and most people show up for their NOUN . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as this chapter has suggested , the provisions of the bill of rights have been VERB and VERB ADV over the past NUM centuries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the first NUM amendments are largely ADJ on the status of traditional common law , which was the legal basis for many of the natural rights VERB by the NOUN in the declaration of independence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unlike the other provisions of the bill of rights , this amendment focuses on power rather than rights . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the courts have generally read the PROPN amendment as ADV VERB , as chief justice PROPN PROPN put it , a “ NOUN that all is VERB which has not been VERB . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> united states v. PROPN PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , rather than limiting the power of the federal government in any ADJ way , it simply VERB what is made obvious ADV in the constitution : the federal government has both enumerated and ADJ powers , but where the federal government does not ( or VERB not to ) exercise power , the states may do so . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the legal NOUN changed ADV as a result of the NUM ruling in roe v. PROPN , roe v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in which the supreme court decided the right to privacy VERB a right for women to VERB a NOUN , at least under certain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the justices ruled that while the government did have an interest in protecting the “ NOUN of human life , ” ADV this had to be VERB against the interests of both women ’s health and women ’s right to decide whether to have an abortion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the united states , many NOUN of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the PROPN PROPN act ( i.e. , PROPN and PROPN america by providing appropriate tools required to VERB and VERB PROPN act ) , passed weeks after the NUM attacks in NUM , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search NOUN or , in some cases , to VERB NOUN requirements ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have argued that the PROPN act has largely been used to VERB ordinary NOUN , in particular drug NOUN , rather than NOUN as intended . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can contrast civil rights with civil liberties , which are NOUN on government power designed to protect our fundamental freedoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the PROPN amendment VERB the application of “ ADJ and unusual NOUN ” to those VERB of crimes , a NOUN on government power . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> discrimination based on gender or sex is generally VERB with intermediate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the standard of intermediate NOUN was first applied by the supreme court in PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) and again in PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) ; PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it requires the government to demonstrate that VERB men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB the burden of NOUN on the government to demonstrate why the ADJ treatment is ADJ , not on the individual who VERB ADJ discrimination has taken place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in practice , this means laws that treat men and women differently are sometimes upheld , although usually they are not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the republican majority in congress was VERB by the actions of the VERB governments of the southern states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in these states , many former confederate politicians and their NOUN VERB to power and attempted to VERB the PROPN amendment ’s NOUN of slaves by passing laws known as the black NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these laws were designed to reduce former slaves to the status of NOUN or ADJ NOUN ; blacks were not just denied the right to vote but also could be arrested and VERB for NOUN or NOUN if they VERB jobs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM way to get involved in the fight for civil rights is to VERB ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the southern poverty law center ( PROPN ) is a not - for - profit NOUN group based in PROPN , PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN for the PROPN VERB in civil rights NOUN and represent many people whose rights have been VERB , from NOUN of hate crimes to ADJ immigrants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the end of the civil war , the south VERB a period called reconstruction ( NUM – NUM ) during which state governments were VERB before the ADJ states were allowed to be VERB to the union . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as part of this process , the republican party pushed for a permanent end to slavery . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN amendment stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on “ race , color , or previous condition of NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this construction allowed states to continue to decide the NOUN of voters as long as those NOUN were ADV race - neutral . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , while states could not VERB african american men the right to vote on the basis of race , they could VERB it to women on the basis of sex or to people who could not VERB they were ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> similarly , state and local governments passed laws limiting what VERB blacks and whites could live in . <sent_end> <sent_begin> collectively , these ADJ laws came to be known as PROPN PROPN laws . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the supreme court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in NUM in PROPN v. ferguson , consistent with the fourteenth amendment ’s equal protection clause , and allowed segregation to continue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. ferguson , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> the NOUN court decision of the judicial phase of the civil rights movement VERB the brown v. board of education case in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> brown v. board of education of PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , the supreme court ADV VERB its decision in PROPN v. ferguson as it VERB to public education , VERB that a separate but equal education was a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even with the same funding and ADJ NOUN , a ADJ school could not have the same NOUN or environment as the ADJ school for another race . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a few months later , in little rock , PROPN , governor PROPN PROPN VERB court - VERB integration and VERB national PROPN troops to keep black students out of central high school . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president PROPN then called up the PROPN national PROPN for federal NOUN ( essentially taking the troops out of PROPN ’s hands ) and sent soldiers of the PROPN PROPN division to VERB students to and from classes , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to avoid integration , PROPN closed NUM high schools in little rock the following school year .

<sent_begin> the slow rate of progress led to NOUN within the african american community . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ , ADJ organizations such as the southern christian leadership PROPN ( PROPN ) , congress of racial equality ( core ) , and student non - violent PROPN committee ( PROPN ) VERB the PROPN ’s position as the leading civil rights organization and VERB its legal - focused strategy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADJ groups VERB to prefer more ADJ NOUN , including the use of direct action campaigns VERB on NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> civil rights NOUN adopted these measures in the NUM – NUM PROPN NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after PROPN PROPN refused to give up her NOUN NOUN to a white person and was arrested , a group of black women carried out a day - long NOUN of PROPN ’s public NOUN system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN was then extended for over a year and VERB by union NOUN e. d. nixon . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the campaign for civil rights continued and gained momentum , president john f. kennedy called for congress to pass new civil rights legislation , which began to work its way through congress in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting law ( pushed ADV and then signed by president PROPN b . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even though the civil rights act of NUM had a ADJ impact over the long term , it did not end efforts by many southern whites to maintain the white - dominated political power structure in the region . <sent_end> <sent_begin> progress in VERB african american voters remained slow in many states despite increased federal activity supporting it , so civil rights leaders including martin PROPN king , PROPN decided to draw the public eye to the area where the greatest resistance to voter registration NOUN were taking place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN and PROPN particularly focused their attention on the city of PROPN , PROPN , which had been the site of violent reactions against civil rights activities . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> martin PROPN king , PROPN ( left ) and PROPN x ( right ) adopted different NOUN to VERB civil rights for african americans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN , a senate debate of the civil rights act of NUM , was the only time the NUM men ever met . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today , a lack of high - paying jobs in many urban areas , combined with ADJ racism , has VERB many african americans in poor NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the civil rights act of NUM created opportunities for members of the black middle class to VERB ADV and ADV , and to live in the same NOUN as the white middle class did , their NOUN left many black NOUN VERB in poverty and without the strong community NOUN that existed during the era of legal segregation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of these NOUN also VERB from high rates of crime and violence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the most ADJ is that it VERB a second NOUN only at the same level of government ( federal or state ) as the first ; the federal government can try you for VERB federal law , even if a state or local court VERB you not ADJ of the same action . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in the early NUM , several PROPN PROPN police officers VERB of ADV VERB NOUN PROPN king during his NOUN were VERB of various charges in a state court , but some were later VERB in a federal court of VERB king ’s civil rights . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the final provision of the fifth amendment has little to do with crime at all . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN clause says that “ private property [ can not ] be taken for public use , without just NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this provision , along with the due process clause ’s provisions limiting the taking of property , can be viewed as a protection of individuals ’ economic liberty : their right to obtain , use , and trade ADJ and ADJ property for their own benefit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , you have the right to trade your knowledge , skills , and labor for money through work or the use of your property , or trade money or goods for other things of value , such as NOUN , housing , education , or food . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> we saw above that james madison and the other NOUN were aware they might VERB some rights if they listed a few in the constitution and VERB others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to ensure that those VERB the constitution would recognize that the NOUN of freedoms and rights in the bill of rights was not ADJ , the PROPN amendment states : <sent_end>

<sent_begin> more ADJ still was the fact that many women ’s rights NOUN , such as PROPN b.

<sent_begin> in the ADJ NOUN , the NOUN house movement of the NUM provided additional relief . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ women such as PROPN PROPN in chicago and PROPN PROPN in new york led this early progressive reform movement in the united states , building upon ideas originally VERB by social NOUN in england . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those middle - class and ADJ NOUN who VERB the ADJ NOUN presented by city life — including NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN — were free to escape to the suburbs , leaving behind the ADJ working classes living in NOUN and ADJ conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> through the city ADJ movement , leaders such as PROPN law PROPN and daniel PROPN sought to NOUN ADJ and upper - class progressive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they VERB the quality of life for city NOUN , but also VERB middle - class - dominated urban spaces in which americans of different NOUN , racial NOUN , and classes worked and lived . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other NOUN of the day took charles PROPN ’s theories in a more ADJ direction , focusing on different theories of NOUN that sought to understand the NOUN underlying the changes in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN believed that ideas and social NOUN must be VERB to work before they could be accepted . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> individuals who experience NOUN might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel ADJ as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a ADJ sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the NOUN point of another person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is VERB as a sense of “ NOUN or NOUN from , or NOUN with , the world , be it individuals , ADJ objects , or all NOUN ” ( apa , NUM , NOUN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person who experiences NOUN might feel as though he is in a NOUN or a NOUN , or that the surrounding world is ADV ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these kinds of NOUN are known as ADJ NOUN , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are VERB to VERB the person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with schizophrenia also may hold ADJ NOUN , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the person who claims to be PROPN PROPN , or who claims to have knowledge going back NUM years , or who claims to be a great NOUN is VERB ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ or ADJ motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming ADV active , VERB ADJ child - like behaviors ( VERB and self - absorbed NOUN ) , engaging in repeated and ADJ movements , or VERB ADJ facial NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some cases , the person will exhibit ADJ behaviors , which show VERB NOUN to the environment , such as NOUN , in which the person VERB a ADJ and ADJ NOUN for long periods of time , or ADJ NOUN , a complete lack of movement and ADJ behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> interest in the role of NOUN in schizophrenia was stimulated by NUM sets of NOUN : drugs that increase NOUN levels can produce schizophrenia - like symptoms , and NOUN that block NOUN activity reduce the symptoms ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an NOUN of NOUN or too many NOUN receptors are responsible for the NOUN and maintenance of schizophrenia ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more recent work in this area suggests that NOUN in NOUN vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> early NOUN and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have VERB survival rates and quality of life for people who VERB from these conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a new approach involves VERB people who show minor symptoms of NOUN , such as unusual thought content , NOUN , ADJ communication , NOUN , problems at school or work , and a decline in social functioning — which are VERB ADJ symptoms — and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a ADJ disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a number of factors have been identified that predict a greater NOUN that ADJ individuals will develop a ADJ disorder : genetic risk ( a family history of NOUN ) , recent NOUN in functioning , high levels of unusual thought content , high levels of NOUN or NOUN , poor social functioning , and a history of substance abuse ( PROPN - PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term personality refers ADV to one ’s stable , consistent , and ADJ way of thinking about , VERB , acting , and VERB to the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that VERB ADV from the expectations of their culture , is ADJ and ADJ , begins in NOUN or early NOUN , and causes distress or NOUN ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> generally , individuals with these disorders exhibit VERB personality NOUN that are extremely ADJ and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people with these disorders usually are ADJ , ADV dramatic , highly emotional , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN c disorders include ADJ personality disorder , dependent personality disorder , and ADJ - ADJ personality disorder ( which is not the same NOUN as ADJ - ADJ disorder ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with these disorders often appear to be nervous and ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mood disorders ( [ link ] ) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions — most often depression , but also NOUN and NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of us experience NOUN in our NOUN and emotional states , and often these NOUN are caused by events in our lives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN — what the dsm-5 refer to as NOUN — are not specific disorders ; rather , they are NOUN used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to VERB certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM NOUN , ADJ pattern , VERB to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major ADJ disorder only during a particular time of year ( e.g. , fall or NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in everyday language , people often refer to this NOUN as the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a person with ADJ disorder ( commonly known as ADJ depression ) often experiences mood states that VERB between depression and NOUN ; that is , the person ’s mood is said to VERB from NUM emotional extreme to the other ( in contrast to ADJ , which indicates a ADV ADJ mood ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if so , what might such NOUN be ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> a study by PROPN and others ( NUM ) suggests that an NOUN in a specific gene that VERB NOUN ( the NUM gene ) might be NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience NOUN of major depression if they carried NUM or NUM short NOUN of this gene than if they carried NUM long NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this theory , which focuses on NOUN in the development of depression , was first described in the late 1980s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men ( PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the ADJ and ADJ focus on the fact that NUM is ADJ and VERB on ADJ symptoms , rather that VERB one ’s self from the symptoms or VERB to address them in an active , problem - solving manner ( PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when people VERB , they have thoughts such as “ why AUX i so ADJ ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ - ADJ and related disorders are a group of ADJ disorders that generally involve ADJ , ADJ thoughts and ADJ behaviors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of us experience ADJ thoughts from time to time ( e.g. , VERB double NOUN when VERB ) , and many of us engage in ADJ behaviors on NOUN ( e.g. , VERB when nervous ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are ADJ and ADJ acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to VERB the distress that NOUN VERB or to reduce the NOUN of a VERB event ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand NOUN , NOUN , VERB ( e.g. , that a NOUN is VERB ) , and NOUN ( e.g. , lining up all the NOUN in a particular way ) , and they also include such mental acts as NOUN , VERB , or VERB something to PRON ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN characteristic of PROPN are not performed out of NOUN , nor are they connected in a ADJ way to the source of the distress or VERB event . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a brain region that is believed to play a critical role in PROPN is the ADJ cortex ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) , an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision - making ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in people with PROPN , the ADJ cortex becomes especially ADJ when they are VERB with tasks in which , for example , they are VERB to look at a NOUN of a NOUN or of NOUN VERB ADV on a wall ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> specific NOUN is a greek word that means fear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person VERB with a specific NOUN ( ADV known as simple NOUN ) experiences excessive , ADJ , and ADJ fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation ( such as animals , VERB spaces , NOUN , or VERB ) ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even though people VERB their level of fear and anxiety in NOUN to the ADJ stimulus is ADJ , some people with a specific NOUN may go to great NOUN to avoid the ADJ stimulus ( the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second pathway of NOUN NOUN is through ADJ learning , such as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a child who VERB his NOUN VERB ADV to NOUN may later express the same NOUN , even though NOUN have never presented any danger to him . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people with panic disorder experience ADJ ( more than NUM ) and ADJ panic attacks , along with at least NUM NOUN of ADJ concern about additional panic attacks , VERB over the consequences of the attacks , or self - VERB changes in behavior related to the attacks ( e.g. , NOUN of exercise or ADJ situations ) ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conditioning theories of panic disorder VERB that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB those normally occurring when NUM is ADJ or ADJ ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , consider a child who has NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for centuries , psychological disorders were viewed from a ADJ perspective : VERB to a force beyond scientific understanding . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those VERB were thought to be NOUN of black NOUN or VERB by NOUN ( [ link ] ) ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN - stress model ( PROPN , NUM ) VERB biological and ADJ factors to predict the NOUN of a disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN - stress model suggests that people with an underlying NOUN for a disorder ( i.e. , a NOUN ) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with ADJ environmental or psychological events ( i.e. , stress ) , such as childhood NOUN , negative life events , NOUN , and so on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such feelings would be normal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you felt extremely ADJ — so much so that you lost interest in activities , had difficulty eating or VERB , felt ADV ADJ , and VERB NOUN — your feelings would be ADJ , would VERB from the NOUN , and could VERB the presence of a psychological disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just because something is ADJ , however , does not necessarily mean it is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many of the features of the ADJ NOUN model are VERB in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the american PROPN association ( apa ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the apa ( NUM ) , a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the dsm-5 also provides information about NOUN ; the NOUN - NOUN of NUM disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the dsm-5 VERB that NUM % of people with ADJ - ADJ disorder ( PROPN ) also meet the diagnostic NOUN for major ADJ disorder ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> psychologists PROPN and PROPN PROPN were personality theorists ( [ link ] ) who focused on NOUN , the NOUN , ADV based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they believed personality is largely VERB by biology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the culture in which you live is NUM of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and NOUN of a particular society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the NOUN of ADV acceptable and ADJ behaviors that are either VERB or VERB ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another method for NOUN of personality is ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this kind of test VERB on NUM of the defense mechanisms proposed by freud — NOUN — as a way to VERB unconscious processes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a third ADJ test is the PROPN PROPN NOUN PROPN ( PROPN ) developed by PROPN PROPN in NUM ( recall his theory of NOUN of control , covered earlier in this chapter ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM forms of this test for use with different age groups : the school form , the college form , and the adult form . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. constitution VERB the treaty process in article ii . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the president VERB a treaty , the senate VERB to the treaty by a NUM - NOUN vote , and finally the president VERB it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the north american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) , are VERB by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the house and senate ( rather than a NUM - NOUN vote in the senate as is the case for a treaty ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the key case of united states v. PROPN ( NUM ) , the supreme court ruled that executive agreements were legally ADJ to NOUN provided they did not alter federal law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> united states v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not VERB NOUN , while some , like the PROPN nuclear agreement , generate considerable debate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many in the senate thought the PROPN deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a ADJ executive agreement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( a ) , the first female secretary of state , was VERB by president bill clinton and ADV VERB by the senate NUM – NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( b ) , VERB by george w. bush , was also ADV VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these ADV focused foreign policy NOUN tend to be ADV the NOUN of the president , including the NOUN of troops and/or intelligence NOUN in a crisis , executive NOUN between the president and other NOUN of state on ADJ matters of foreign policy , presidential use of military force , and NOUN funding measures to deal with foreign policy NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these measures of foreign policy are more quickly VERB and demonstrate the “ energy and NOUN ” that PROPN hamilton , writing in the federalist papers , saw as ADJ in the institution of the presidency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN spending does involve congress through its power of the NOUN , but congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> probably the most extreme version of this potential ADJ occurred during the PROPN presidency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when president PROPN d. PROPN used too many executive agreements instead of VERB key ones to the senate as NOUN , congress VERB by VERB a constitutional amendment ( the PROPN amendment ) that would have VERB the treaty process as we know it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN understood the message and began to VERB more agreements through the process as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , congressional party leaders in the majority and minority parties VERB on behalf of their institution and their party on all types of issues , including foreign policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some house and senate members VERB to serve on the foreign policy committees , such as the senate committee on foreign relations , the house foreign affairs committee , and the NUM defense committees ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these members might have military NOUN within their NOUN or states and hence have a NOUN reason for being interested in foreign policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the national security NOUN VERB the president ’s national security council , a group of senior - level NOUN from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy NOUN . also VERB to the president in the white house is the director of the central intelligence agency ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even more important on intelligence than the PROPN director is the director of national intelligence , a position created in the government NOUN after NUM , who VERB the entire intelligence community in the u.s. government . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> there is an element of NOUN in liberal NOUN , because the united states VERB other countries will also put their best NOUN forward . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ example of a liberal NOUN is president PROPN wilson , who sought a PROPN of nations to ADV save the world after world war i . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN believe that rather than VERB NOUN and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes , the united states should ADV use its might to promote its values and NOUN around the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ use ( or threat ) of hard power is the core value of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> acting ADV is acceptable in this view , as is VERB a ADJ strategy in which the united states VERB ADV before the NOUN can make its move . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> ADV , violence VERB ADV against chinese , japanese , PROPN , and ADJ caused members of these groups to VERB around a shared ADJ - ADJ identity , much as native americans had in the ADJ - indian movement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , students of ADJ NOUN at the university of california at PROPN formed the ADJ american political PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ american students also VERB PROPN , native american , and african american students to demand that NOUN offer ADJ studies NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> see william PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , the american psychological association ended its NOUN of NOUN as a mental disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the u.s. military adopted the policy of “ do n’t VERB , do n’t VERB . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this act , department of defense PROPN NUM , ADV prohibited discrimination against VERB NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN by the u.s. military . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also prohibited ADJ officers from VERB about or VERB the sexual orientation of those below them in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> public law NUM – NUM : national defense PROPN act for fiscal year NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , those NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN who VERB ADV about their sexual orientation were still subject to NOUN because it remained illegal for anyone except NOUN to serve in the ADJ forces . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of same - sex marriage throughout the united states led some people to feel their religious beliefs were under attack , and many ADV conservative business owners have refused to VERB PROPN rights or the NOUN of same - sex NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> following ADV upon the NOUN of the PROPN ruling , the PROPN legislature passed a religious freedom PROPN act ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> congress had already passed such a law in NUM ; it was intended to extend protection to minority NOUN , such as by allowing NOUN of the native american church . <sent_end>

PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , the americans with PROPN act ( PROPN ) greatly expanded opportunities and protections for people of all NOUN with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also significantly expanded the categories and definition of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather , we do not have to . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the reason why is something called the division and NOUN of labor , a production innovation first put ADP by PROPN smith , [ link ] , in his book , the wealth of nations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN smith introduced the idea of VERB labor into ADJ tasks . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , NOUN in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( in later NOUN , we will develop this idea by VERB comparative advantage . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> people have different skills , NOUN , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> john PROPN keynes ( NUM ) , NUM of the greatest economists of the twentieth century , VERB out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking . <sent_end> <sent_begin> keynes , shown in [ link ] , famously wrote in the NOUN to a ADJ economist ’s book : “ [ economics ] is a method rather than a doctrine , an NOUN of the mind , a technique of thinking , which helps its NOUN to draw correct NOUN . ” in other words , economics VERB you how to think , not what to think . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a market economy , decision - making is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> market economies are based on private NOUN : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and VERB by private individuals or groups of private individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> businesses supply goods and services based on demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was VERB for a selection of countries from NUM to NUM , according to an NOUN known as the world bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> exports are the goods and services that are produced ADV and sold abroad . <sent_end> <sent_begin> imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN cost $ NUM each , and NOUN NOUN are NUM NOUN each . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows PROPN ’s budget constraint , that is , the outer NOUN of his opportunity set . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the opportunity set VERB all the opportunities for spending within his budget . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these decisions do not look back to past choices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the budget constraint framework VERB that VERB costs , which are costs that were VERB in the past and can not be VERB , should not affect the current decision . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> productive efficiency means that , given the available inputs and technology , it is impossible to produce more of NUM good without VERB the quantity that is produced of another good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all choices on the PROPN in [ link ] , including a , b , c , d , and f , display productive efficiency . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country , we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in our example , brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar NOUN and the u.s. has a comparative advantage in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first NOUN is NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is not ADJ to have ADJ amounts of both goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied . <sent_end> <sent_begin> price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( PROPN ) or supplied ( PROPN ) and the ADJ percent change in price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . NOUN can be ADV divided into NUM broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an elastic demand or elastic supply is NUM in which the elasticity is greater than NUM , VERB a high NOUN to changes in price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN that are less than NUM indicate low NOUN to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> then , those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand : price elasticity of PROPN change in PROPN change in PROPN elasticity of PROPN change in PROPN change in NUM , the elasticity of demand from g to h NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the magnitude of the elasticity has increased ( in absolute value ) as we moved up along the demand curve from points a to b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that the elasticity between these NUM points was NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( PROPN ) or supplied ( PROPN ) changes by an ADJ amount in response to any change in price at all . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while perfectly elastic supply curves are ADJ , goods with ADV available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , in some cases , the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , many chemical companies use NOUN as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price for ADJ oil . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN use NOUN as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer NOUN , because they are buying more NOUN instead , or those with a higher income might buy less ADJ NOUN and more imported NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the income elasticity of demand is negative , the good is called an ADJ good . the concepts of normal and ADJ goods were introduced in demand and supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good , which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in markets for financial capital , the elasticity of savings — that is , the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates — will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> private NOUN , the ownership of businesses by private individuals , is a NOUN of the u.s. economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when people think of businesses , often NOUN like PROPN - PROPN , PROPN , or general PROPN come to mind . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NUM NOUN of cost are important for VERB between NUM NOUN of profit , accounting profit and economic profit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> accounting profit is a cash concept . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a firm looks at its total costs of production in the short run , a useful starting point is to divide total costs into NUM categories : fixed costs that can not be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed . fixed and variable costs <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at some point , you may even see negative returns as the additional NOUN begin VERB NOUN and getting in each other ’s way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , the addition of still more NOUN would actually cause output to decrease , as shown in the last NOUN of [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern of VERB marginal returns is common in production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as another example , consider the problem of VERB a NOUN on a NOUN ’s field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> marginal cost is somewhat different . <sent_end> <sent_begin> marginal cost is the additional cost of producing NUM more unit of output . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced , but only the next NUM ( or next few ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this pattern was illustrated earlier in [ PUNCT the middle portion of the long - run average cost curve , the flat portion of the curve around NOUN , economies of scale have been VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this situation , allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production , and it is called constant returns to scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this range of the PROPN curve , the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the price of a NOUN of gasoline goes up , for example , people look for ways to reduce their consumption by VERB several NOUN , VERB by NOUN or mass NOUN , or taking NOUN or NOUN NOUN ADV to home . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists call this ADJ relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law of demand VERB that all other variables that affect demand ( to be explained in the next NOUN ) are held constant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when economists VERB about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> price is what the producer receives for selling NUM unit of a good or service . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the price of gasoline rises , for example , it VERB profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand NOUN for oil reserves ; VERB for more oil ; VERB in more NOUN and oil NOUN to bring the oil to plants where it can be VERB into gasoline ; build new oil NOUN ; purchase additional NOUN and NOUN to VERB the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied — that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied — the law of supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law of supply VERB that all other variables that affect supply ( to be explained in the next NOUN ) are held constant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> remember this : when NUM lines on a diagram cross , this NOUN usually means something . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the point where the supply curve ( s ) and the demand curve ( d ) cross , VERB by point e in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , at any above - equilibrium price , the quantity supplied VERB the quantity demanded . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we call this an excess supply or a surplus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between NUM , and only NUM , variables : quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no ADJ economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they will be less likely to VERB an NOUN and more likely to own a home , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a product whose demand falls when income rises , and vice ADV , is called an ADJ good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , when income increases , the demand curve shifts to the left . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other goods are NOUN for each other , meaning that the goods are often used together , because consumption of NUM good tends to VERB consumption of the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples include NOUN NOUN and NOUN ; NOUN and NOUN or NOUN , NOUN NOUN and NOUN NOUN ; gasoline and NOUN utility NOUN ; and the NUM - way combination of NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in thinking about the factors that affect supply , remember what VERB firms : profits , which are the difference between NOUN and costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> goods and services are produced using NOUN of labor , materials , and NOUN , or what we call inputs or factors of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a firm faces lower costs of production , while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain ADJ , a firm ’s profits go up . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how can an economist NOUN out all these ADJ events ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the answer VERB in the ADJ ADJ assumption . <sent_end> <sent_begin> look at how each economic event affects each market , NUM event at a time , holding all else constant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> price controls come in NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a price NOUN VERB a price from rising above a certain level ( the “ NOUN ” ) , while a price floor VERB a price from falling below a certain level ( the “ floor ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this section uses the demand and supply framework to VERB price NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if NOUN ’ NOUN in PROPN - PROPN . paul - PROPN are higher than in other cities , more NOUN will move to PROPN - PROPN . paul - PROPN to find jobs , more people will be willing to VERB as NOUN , and those ADV VERB as NOUN will be more likely to VERB NOUN as a full - time job . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , there will be more NOUN looking for jobs in the area . at equilibrium , the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , every NOUN who VERB to hire a NOUN at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker , and every NOUN who VERB to work at this equilibrium NOUN can find a job . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the labor market , however , VERB some prominent examples of price NOUN , which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low - paid workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. government sets a minimum wage , a price floor that makes it illegal for an NOUN to pay employees less than a certain ADJ rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , the u.s. minimum wage was raised to $ NUM per hour . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many states do have NOUN laws , which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that NOUN can charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> information on the consumption choices of americans is available from the consumer expenditure survey carried out by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows spending patterns for the average u.s. household . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN VERB to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility , which is the term economists use to describe a person ’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices . let ’s begin with an assumption , which will be discussed in more detail later , that PROPN can measure his own utility with something called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( it is important to note that you can not make NOUN between the NOUN of individuals ; if NUM person VERB NUM NOUN from a NOUN of NOUN and another VERB NUM NOUN , this does not mean than the first person VERB more NOUN from the NOUN than the other or that they VERB the NOUN ADV as much . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar . <sent_end> <sent_begin> marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility PROPN receives given the price of the product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for PROPN ’s t - NOUN and NOUN , the marginal utility per dollar is shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let ’s begin with a ADJ example VERB how changes in income level affect consumer choices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a budget constraint that represents PROPN ’s choice between NOUN NOUN at $ NUM each and getting away ADV to a NOUN - and - NOUN for $ NUM per night . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN has $ NUM per year to spend between these NUM choices . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a choice like p means that a rise in income caused her quantity VERB of NOUN NOUN to decline , while a choice like q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of NOUN to decline . <sent_end> <sent_begin> goods where demand VERB as income rises ( or conversely , where the demand rises as income falls ) are called “ ADJ goods . ” an ADJ good occurs when people VERB back on a good as income rises , because they can now VERB the more expensive choices that they prefer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a higher - income household might eat fewer NOUN or be less likely to buy a used car , and instead eat more NOUN and buy a new car . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rates of saving in america have never been especially high , but they seem to have VERB even lower in recent years , as the data from the bureau of economic analysis in [ link ] show . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a decision about how much to save can be represented using an ADJ budget constraint . <sent_end> <sent_begin> household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of NOUN as the consumption choice decision and the labor - NOUN decision . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this NOUN suggests some NOUN about political NOUN to encourage higher savings by providing NOUN with a higher rate of return . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , individual PROPN accounts ( PROPN ) and X ) accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not VERB until it is taken out many years later , after NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the main difference between these accounts is that an PROPN is usually set up by an individual , while a NUM ) needs to be set up through an NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another area that seems ADJ is the idea of mental accounting , or VERB dollars in different mental categories where they take different values . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists typically consider dollars to be ADJ , or having equal value to the individual , regardless of the situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you might , for instance , think of the $ NUM you found in the street differently from the $ NUM you earned from NUM hours working in a ADJ food NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a perfectly competitive firm is known as a price NOUN , because the pressure of competing firms forces them to VERB the VERB equilibrium price in the market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a firm in a perfectly competitive market VERB the price of its product by so much as a NOUN , it will lose all of its sales to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] VERB the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling NUM more unit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as mentioned before , a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product — that is , the firm ’s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but in the long run , firms that are VERB losses will VERB down at least some of their output , and some firms will VERB production ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the long - run process of reducing production in response to a ADJ pattern of losses is called exit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following clear it up feature VERB where some of these losses might come from , and the reasons why some firms go out of business . why do firms VERB to exist ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for a constant cost industry , ADV there is an increase in market demand and price , then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms ’ entry and VERB at the point where the new long - run equilibrium VERB at the same market price as before . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but why will costs remain the same ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when profit - VERB firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility - VERB consumers , something ADJ happens : the resulting quantities of NOUN of goods and services demonstrate both productive and ADJ efficiency ( terms that were first introduced in ( choice in a world of NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> productive efficiency means producing without waste , so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the long run in a perfectly competitive market , because of the process of entry and exit , the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long - run average cost curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these profits should attract ADJ competition as described in perfect competition , and yet , because of NUM particular characteristic of monopoly , they do not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> barriers to entry are the legal , technological , or market forces that VERB or prevent potential NOUN from entering a market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily ADJ , such as the cost of VERB ADJ space , to the extremely ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( this NOUN was introduced in cost and industry structure ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN , according to the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN office , “ is a form of protection provided by the laws of the united states for PUNCT original works of NOUN ’ including ADJ , dramatic , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ NOUN . ” no one can reproduce , display , or perform a VERB work without NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing NOUN service changed from NOUN to NOUN and NOUN transmission , so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the same NOUN VERB to local service , especially in recent years , with the growth in cellular NOUN systems . the combination of NOUN in production NOUN and a general sense that the markets could provide services ADV led to a wave of NOUN , starting in the late 1970s and VERB into the NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this wave VERB or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter , the prices that could be charged , and the quantities that could be produced in many industries , including NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , banking , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but a NOUN often has fairly ADJ information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal NOUN and marginal costs , because it has had experience with such changes over time and because ADJ changes are ADJ to VERB from current experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit - VERB combination of quantity and price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ efficiency is a social concept . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it refers to producing the ADJ quantity of some output , the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of NUM more unit just VERB the marginal cost . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM type of ADV competitive market is called ADJ competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms , but the products that they sell are not identical . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a firm can try to make its products different from those of its NOUN in several ways : physical aspects of the product , location from which the product is sold , ADJ aspects of the product , and perceptions of the product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> products that are ADJ in NUM of these ways are called ADJ products . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as an example of a profit - VERB ADJ NOUN , consider the ADJ chinese PROPN store , which serves NOUN with NOUN , ADJ and ADJ NOUN , and your choice of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although ADJ chinese PROPN must VERB against other NOUN businesses and NOUN , it has a ADJ product . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new NOUN will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve VERB the average cost curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when price is equal to average cost , economic profits are NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of market - oriented economies argue that society does not really need NOUN of different ADJ shoes or NOUN NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product NOUN , and then of NOUN and NOUN this NOUN , is ADV ADJ — that is , most people would be just as ADJ with a smaller range of ADJ products produced and sold at a lower price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of a market - oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy ADJ products or highly VERB NOUN names , no one is VERB them to do so . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> quantity demanded in the market may also be NUM or NUM times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve — which means that the market would have room for only NUM or NUM NOUN firms ( and they need not produce ADJ products ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> again , smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to VERB , while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a ADJ price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the united states , as well as many other countries , it is illegal for firms to VERB since NOUN is anti - competitive behavior , which is a NOUN of antitrust law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both the antitrust division of the justice department and the federal trade commission have responsibilities for preventing NOUN in the united states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN ’s NOUN is a NOUN in which the gains from NOUN are larger than the NOUN from VERB self - interest . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB well to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a group of u.s. companies signed such a contract , however , it would be illegal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> certain international organizations , like the nations that are members of the organization of PROPN PROPN countries ( PROPN ) , have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly , hold down output , and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such agreements , however , because they fall in a ADJ area of international law , are not legally ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , if NOUN always VERB price cuts by other firms in the NOUN , but do not VERB price increases , then NOUN of the NOUN will have a strong incentive to change prices , since the potential gains are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this strategy can work like a ADJ form of NOUN , in which the NOUN successfully VERB to hold down output , increase price , and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally ADJ agreement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the laws that give government the power to block certain NOUN , and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones , are called antitrust laws . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before a large NOUN happens , the antitrust NOUN at the PROPN and the u.s. department of justice can allow the NOUN , VERB it , or allow it if certain conditions are met . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also in NUM , the federal trade commission ( PROPN ) was created to define more specifically what competition was ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the PROPN - PROPN act extended the PROPN act by VERB vertical and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NUM - first century , the PROPN and the u.s. department of justice continue to enforce antitrust laws . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these NUM cases is called the PROPN - PROPN index ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN , as it is often called , is calculated by VERB the NOUN of the market share of each firm in the industry , as the following work it out shows . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for more on the NOUN of VERB markets , refer to monopoly . this new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies , instead of VERB a market and VERB up total sales . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a common starting point is for antitrust NOUN to use statistical tools and real - world evidence to VERB the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are VERB the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a second step is to VERB how competition occurs in this specific industry . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an exclusive NOUN agreement between a NOUN and a NOUN can be legal or illegal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> computer NOUN NOUN may often VERB together a number of different programs , even when the buyer VERB only a few of the programs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> think about the NOUN that is included in a new computer purchase , for example . recall from the chapter on monopoly that ADJ NOUN occurs when the existing firm ( or firms ) VERB to a new firm by VERB prices very low , until the new firm is driven out of the market , at which point the existing firm VERB prices again . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern of NOUN is VERB at VERB the entry of new firms into the market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so what then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates the case of natural monopoly , with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward - VERB portion of the average cost curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> points a , b , c , and f VERB NUM of the main choices for regulation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , in the 1980s and 1990s , some NOUN of public NOUN began to use price NOUN regulation , where the NOUN sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a common pattern was to require a price that VERB slightly over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a number of major accounting NOUN involving prominent corporations such as PROPN , PROPN international , and PROPN led to the PROPN - PROPN act in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN - PROPN was designed to increase NOUN in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this case , the sellers and buyers of NOUN NOUN may both be quite ADJ with their voluntary exchange , but you have no voice in their market NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called NOUN . externalities can be negative or positive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if you hate country music , then having it VERB into your house every night would be a negative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free NOUN would be a positive NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now imagine that firms which produce NOUN must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a NOUN , but also the broader costs to society of NOUN to health and other values caused by pollution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the firm is required to pay $ NUM for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a NOUN , production becomes more ADJ and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , the environmental protection agency ( PROPN ) was created to VERB all environmental laws . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the same year , the PROPN air act was VERB to address air pollution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just NUM years later , in NUM , congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching PROPN water act . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the marginal cost of pollution reduction , like most most marginal cost curves increases with output , at least in the short run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> reducing the first NUM NOUN of NOUN NOUN costs the firm $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN VERB out that this issue can not be VERB until property rights are clearly defined — that is , the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to VERB without paying NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> does the NOUN have a property right not to have a field VERB ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates a ADJ model of this situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive — for example , at quantity NOUN — there are usually a NOUN of relatively ADJ and easy ways to reduce pollution , and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at PROPN , it makes sense to VERB more resources to fight pollution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although a nation can protect NOUN within its own NOUN , no nation acting alone can protect NOUN around the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> global NOUN and NOUN are examples of international externalities . VERB the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of NOUN between countries with different income levels and different sets of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if nations such as china , PROPN , brazil , mexico , and others are developing their economies by VERB vast amounts of fossil NOUN or by VERB their NOUN and NOUN NOUN , then the world ’s high - income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce NOUN gases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between p , q , r , s and t in [ link ] , all of which VERB along the production possibility frontier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> countries with low per capita ADJ domestic product ( gdp ) , such as china , place a greater emphasis on economic output — which in turn helps to produce NOUN , NOUN , health , education , and ADJ consumer goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> countries with higher income levels , where a greater share of people have access to the basic NOUN of life , may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> market competition can provide an incentive for VERB new technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more ADV or to create products with characteristics consumers want . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as PROPN PROPN , PROPN of PROPN said , “ ADJ NOUN of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to VERB a world of NOUN with technology . ” an ADJ firm VERB that it will usually have a ADJ NOUN over its NOUN and thus an ability to earn above - normal profits before NOUN can VERB up . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a firm VERB a factory or VERB a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , when a firm VERB in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether VERB by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if big drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies , its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve PROPN , and it would be willing to borrow and VERB $ NUM NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , if big drug is receiving only NUM NOUN of each dollar of social benefits , the firm will not spend as much on creating new products . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after all , positive externalities exist from investment in education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while not always easy to measure , according to PROPN PROPN , the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population , lower levels of crime , a ADJ environment and a more stable , democratic government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for these reasons , many nations have VERB to use NOUN dollars to VERB primary , secondary , and higher education . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> state and federal governments support research in a variety of ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , united for medical research , a NOUN of groups that seek funding for the national PROPN of health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ PROPN - supported research added $ NUM NUM to our gdp and supported NUM NUM jobs in NUM alone . ” the united states remains the leading NOUN of medical - related research spending $ NUM NUM in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other institutions , such as the national PROPN of scientists and the national PROPN of PROPN , receive federal grants for ADJ projects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what about a situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> this kind of good is called a public good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> spending on national defense is a good example of a public good . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when individuals make decisions about buying a public good , a free NOUN problem can arise , in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to “ free NOUN ” on the purchases of others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the free NOUN problem can be expressed in terms of the NOUN ’s NOUN NOUN , which is discussed as a representation of NOUN in PROPN competition and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> try this ADJ activity that VERB a memory - VERB strategy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you could also VERB memory by using ADJ NOUN : a technique in which you think about the meaning of the new information and its NOUN to knowledge already stored in your memory ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in this case , you could remember that NUM is an area code for arizona and the person you met is from arizona . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> across these NUM NOUN — physical , cognitive , and ADJ — the ADJ approach to development is also discussed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this approach VERB , “ what is normal development ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the early decades of the ADJ century , ADJ psychologists studied large numbers of children at various NOUN to determine norms ( i.e. , average NOUN ) of when most children reach specific developmental NOUN in each of the NUM NOUN ( PROPN , NUM , NUM , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> continuous development views development as a ADJ process , gradually VERB on existing skills ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with this type of development , there is ADJ change . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the field of behavioral NOUN , the PROPN study of PROPN VERB apart — a well - known study of the genetic basis for personality — conducted research with NOUN from NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in studying NUM pairs of NOUN , including pairs of identical and ADJ NOUN VERB together and apart , researchers found that identical NOUN , whether raised together or apart , have very similar NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN freud ( NUM – NUM ) believed that personality develops during early childhood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for freud , childhood experiences shape our NOUN and behavior as adults . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage NOUN , took freud ’s theory and modified it as ADJ theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s ADJ development theory VERB the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood , PROPN proposed that personality development takes place all through the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> young children put objects in their NOUN to see if the items are ADJ , and once they can VERB objects , they may VERB or VERB them to see if they make sounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> between NUM and NUM months old , the child develops object NOUN , which is the understanding that even if something is out of NOUN , it still exists ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , young NOUN do not remember an object after it has been removed from NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during this stage , we also expect children to display NOUN , which means that the child is not able to take the perspective of others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a child at this stage VERB that everyone VERB , VERB , and VERB just as they do . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fourth , and last , stage in PROPN ’s theory is the formal ADJ stage , which is from about age NUM to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> whereas children in the ADJ ADJ stage are able to think ADV only about ADJ events , children in the formal ADJ stage can also deal with ADJ ideas and ADJ situations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of psychology tend to focus on NUM influence or behavior over others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , PROPN holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they tend to VERB to recognize when the behavior of another is due to ADJ variables , and thus to the person ’s state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ assumption is called the fundamental NOUN error ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to better understand , imagine this NOUN : PROPN returns home from work , and upon opening the front NOUN his NOUN ADV VERB him and VERB about his day . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you might say you were very ADJ or VERB ADJ and needed ADJ time — a ADJ explanation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN - NOUN bias is the phenomenon of VERB other people ’s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental NOUN error ) while VERB our own behavior to ADJ forces ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as NOUN of behavior , we have more information available to explain our own behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a common NOUN , or NOUN , in the united states is the just - world hypothesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the just - world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they VERB ( PROPN & miller , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order to maintain the belief that the world is a ADJ place , people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes , and bad people experience negative outcomes ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & major , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN occurs when sperm VERB an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a zygote begins as a NUM - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the genetic makeup and sex of the NOUN are set at this point . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now blood vessels grow , forming the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is a structure connected to the NOUN that provides NOUN and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the ADJ cord . <sent_end> <sent_begin> basic structures of the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each organ of the NOUN develops during a specific period in the NOUN , called the critical or sensitive period ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , research with ADJ models of PROPN has demonstrated that the time during which a developing NOUN is exposed to alcohol can ADV affect the appearance of facial characteristics associated with ADJ alcohol syndrome . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and VERB objects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ motor skills focus on the muscles in our NOUN , NOUN , and eyes , and enable NOUN of small actions ( e.g. , VERB a NOUN , writing with a NOUN , and using a NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and NOUN and involve larger movements ( e.g. , VERB , running , and NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he VERB his NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN said that NUM things are needed for a healthy attachment : the NOUN must be ADJ to the child ’s physical , social , and emotional needs ; and the NOUN and child must engage in ADV ADJ interactions ( PROPN , NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in cases of ADJ attachment , children tend to show ADJ behavior , but then they VERB the attachment figure ’s attempts to interact with them ( PROPN & bell , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these children do not explore the NOUN in the room , as they are too ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ style , the parent places high value on NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the parents are often strict , ADV VERB their children , and express little NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you can see , NOUN NOUN influence childhood NOUN , but could a child ’s NOUN ADV influence NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to innate traits that influence how one VERB , VERB , and VERB with the environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> children with easy NOUN demonstrate positive emotions , VERB well to change , and are capable of VERB their emotions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the NOUN and NOUN in females and NOUN in males . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary sexual characteristics are physical NOUN of sexual NOUN that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of NOUN and NOUN in NOUN , and development of facial hair and a VERB voice in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cognitive NOUN , also known as theory - of - mind ( which we discussed earlier with regard to NOUN ) , VERB to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others ( PROPN - PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cognitive NOUN begins to increase in NOUN and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , until about NUM years ago in the united states , a NOUN might not VERB someone that they were VERB , and the majority of NOUN occurred in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM that reality began to change with PROPN PROPN , who created the first modern NOUN in england . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of NOUN is to help provide a death with NOUN and pain management in a ADJ and ADJ environment , which is usually outside of a NOUN setting . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> think back to what you VERB learned about NOUN development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is it about pre - NOUN and young NOUN that make them want to fit in ( [ link ] ) ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN prison experiment has some NOUN with the abuse of NOUN of war by u.s. army troops and PROPN NOUN at the PROPN PROPN prison in NUM and NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN at PROPN PROPN were VERB by NOUN of the abuse , some taken by the NOUN themselves ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN of war were VERB by their american NOUN in PROPN PROPN prison , during the second iraq war . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : united states department of defense ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self - NOUN or positive self - image . <sent_end> <sent_begin> psychologist PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) defined cognitive NOUN as psychological NOUN VERB from holding NUM or more ADJ attitudes , behaviors , or NOUN ( thoughts , beliefs , or NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s theory of cognitive NOUN states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs ADV to our positive self - perceptions , we experience psychological NOUN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> SCONJ the ADJ military example and group initiation , can you think of other examples of cognitive NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> here is NUM : PROPN and PROPN live in PROPN county , PROPN , which is NUM of the ADJ areas in the united states and has a very high cost of living . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the war , PROPN continued his NOUN of NOUN at PROPN university . <sent_end> <sent_begin> out of this work came a model called the PROPN NOUN change approach , which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN demonstrated that certain features of the source of a ADJ message , the content of the message , and the characteristics of the NOUN will influence the NOUN of a message ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the peripheral route is an ADJ route that uses peripheral cues to associate NOUN with the message ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’s quality , the peripheral route VERB on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the remaining members of the group were NOUN of the researcher . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the researcher . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are used to VERB social situations as part of the research design , and the true , ADJ participants believe that NOUN are , like them , ADJ participants in the experiment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the finding that NOUN is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret , so we are not VERB by others ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN effect can be easily seen in children when they have to ADV vote for something . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if the NOUN VERB whether the children would rather have extra NOUN , no NOUN , or NOUN , once a few children vote , the rest will VERB and go with the majority . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another form of social influence is NOUN to authority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the change of an individual ’s behavior to VERB with a demand by an authority figure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people often VERB with the NOUN because they are concerned about a NOUN if they do not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another phenomenon of group NOUN is NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the modification of the NOUN of members of a group to VERB with what they believe is the group NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in group situations , the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social PROPN <sent_end> <sent_begin> another way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social NOUN is the NOUN of less effort by a person working together with a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social NOUN occurs when our individual performance can not be VERB ADV from the group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a NOUN of its concern for candidate characteristics , industrial psychology must also consider issues of NOUN regarding discrimination in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees affect those employees and the performance of a business . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this includes studying worker satisfaction , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> with the rapid growth of technology , and widely available ADJ technology and social NOUN media , a new form of NOUN has emerged : VERB ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB , like NOUN , is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or emotional NOUN to another person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is unique about NOUN is that it is typically ADJ , VERB , done in private , and the NOUN can remain ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because there were many NOUN to the attack on PROPN , as VERB by the number of VERB NOUN NOUN in the building , individuals VERB someone else must have already called the police . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> a useful way to VERB stress is to view it as a process ADV an individual VERB and VERB to events that he VERB as ADJ or VERB to his well - being ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a critical element of this definition is that it VERB the importance of how we VERB — that is , judge — VERB or ADJ events ( often referred to as NOUN ) ; these NOUN , in turn , influence our reactions to such events . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the perception of a threat triggers a secondary NOUN : NOUN of the NOUN available to VERB with a stressor , as well as perceptions of how effective such NOUN will be ( PROPN , NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you may recall from what you learned about self - NOUN , an individual ’s belief in his ability to complete a task is important ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and the general PROPN PROPN important early NOUN to the stress field was PROPN PROPN , mentioned earlier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he would eventually become NUM of the world ’s ADJ NOUN in the study of stress ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> as our society becomes increasingly ADJ and ADJ , mental health NOUN must develop cultural NOUN ( [ link ] ) , which means they must understand and address issues of race , culture , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they must also develop strategies to effectively address the needs of various populations for which ADJ NOUN have limited application ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1960s , NOUN thomas PROPN and richard PROPN wanted to VERB the link between life NOUN and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life NOUN are stressful , whether these events are ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they developed the social PROPN PROPN scale ( PROPN ) , consisting of NUM life events that require varying NOUN of personal NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many life events that most people would consider ADJ ( e.g. , NOUN , NOUN , marriage ) are among those listed on the PROPN ; these are examples of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the specific NOUN for these NOUN are diverse , they seem to share NUM common NOUN : ADJ NOUN and NOUN about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both of these factors contribute to job NOUN , a work situation that VERB excessive job demands and NOUN with little NOUN in decision making or job control ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> clearly , many NOUN other than the ones listed in [ link ] involve at least a moderate amount of job NOUN in that they often involve ADJ NOUN and little job control ( e.g. , inability to decide when to take NOUN ) . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> in a NOUN ’s office , you might see a patient NOUN on a NOUN speaking of dreams or childhood memories , and the therapist using various ADJ methods such as free association and NOUN analysis ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in free association , the patient VERB and then says DET comes to mind at the moment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , freud felt that the NOUN would at times try to block , or VERB , ADJ NOUN or ADJ NOUN during free association . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today , freud ’s ADJ perspective has been expanded upon by the NOUN of subsequent theories and NOUN : the ADJ perspective . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this approach to therapy remains VERB on the role of people ’s internal NOUN and forces , but treatment is less ADJ than freud ’s original model . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , NOUN help their patients look into their past to VERB ADJ feelings . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in behavior therapy , a therapist VERB principles of learning to help clients change ADJ behaviors — rather than VERB deeply into one ’s unconscious . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN with this orientation believe that ADJ behaviors , like NOUN and NOUN , can be changed by VERB clients new , more ADJ behaviors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in exposure therapy , a therapist VERB to treat clients ’ NOUN or anxiety by VERB them with the object or situation that causes their problem , with the idea that they will eventually get used to it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this can be done via reality , NOUN , or ADJ reality . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM popular NOUN conditioning NOUN is called the ADJ economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this involves a controlled setting where individuals are VERB for ADJ behaviors with NOUN , such as a NOUN NOUN , that can be VERB for items or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN : cognitive - behavioral NOUN - behavioral NOUN focus much more on present issues than on a patient ’s childhood or past , as in other forms of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational ADJ therapy ( PROPN ) , which was founded by PROPN PROPN and grew out of his NOUN of ADJ NOUN ( daniel , PROPN . ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN such as PROPN PROPN also influenced PROPN ’s ADJ approach ( national association of cognitive - behavioral PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cognitive - behavioral therapy ( PROPN ) helps clients VERB how their thoughts affect their behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> psychologist PROPN rogers developed a ADJ orientation known as PROPN , or NOUN - VERB therapy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note the change from patients to clients . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> as ADV described in his statement , our reaction to potential NOUN depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to VERB influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major NOUN for our health and happiness ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of ADJ outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well - being ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while having social support is quite beneficial , being the NOUN of ADJ attitudes and ADJ behaviors is associated with a number of negative outcomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in their NOUN review , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN ( NUM ) describe how racial prejudice and discrimination serve as unique , significant NOUN for those who are the NOUN of such attitudes and behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> being the target of racism is associated with increased rates of depression , VERB self - NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ disease . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> in terms of our health , the expression , “ do n’t VERB , be ADJ ” is ADJ NOUN indeed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there has also been much work VERB that NOUN — the general tendency to look on the ADJ side of things — is also a significant NOUN of positive health outcomes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the late NOUN , a french NOUN , PROPN PROPN , argued for more ADJ treatment of the ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he suggested that they be ADJ and VERB to , and that ’s just what he did for patients at PROPN PROPN in PROPN in NUM ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> to find NOUN to these questions , we need to understand the concept of elasticity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> elasticity is an economics concept that measures NOUN of NUM variable to changes in another variable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB you VERB NUM items from a second - floor NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . NOUN can be ADV divided into NUM broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an elastic demand or elastic supply is NUM in which the elasticity is greater than NUM , VERB a high NOUN to changes in price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN that are less than NUM indicate low NOUN to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN indicate proportional NOUN of either demand or supply , as VERB in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( PROPN ) or supplied ( PROPN ) changes by an ADJ amount in response to any change in price at all . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> constant ADJ elasticity , in either a supply or demand curve , occurs when a price change of NUM percent results in a quantity change of NUM percent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> income elasticity of demand <sent_end> <sent_begin> the income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income . <sent_end> <sent_begin> income elasticity of demand NUM % change in quantity demanded % change in VERB elasticity of demand NUM % change in quantity demanded % change in income <sent_end> <sent_begin> for most products , most of the time , the income elasticity of demand is positive : that is , a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer NOUN , because they are buying more NOUN instead , or those with a higher income might buy less ADJ NOUN and more imported NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> elasticity in labor and financial capital PROPN concept of elasticity VERB to any market , not just markets for goods and services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the labor market , for example , the wage elasticity of labor supply — that is , the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages — will determine the shape of the labor supply curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> specifically : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the firm is successful , the NOUN are more ADJ than the inputs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this activity of production goes beyond NOUN ( i.e. , making things ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it includes any process or service that creates value , including transportation , distribution , ADJ and ADJ sales . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> wages that a firm pays its employees or VERB that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ costs are more ADJ , but just as important . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cost of producing a firm ’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer NOUN or NOUN or ADJ - food NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> variable costs , on the other hand , are VERB in the act of producing — the more you produce , the greater the variable cost . <sent_end> <sent_begin> labor is treated as a variable cost , since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but as output VERB still further , the average cost begins to rise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the right side of the average cost curve , total costs begin rising more rapidly as VERB returns VERB in . <sent_end> <sent_begin> average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the variable cost of producing NUM NOUN is $ NUM , so the average variable cost is $ NUM / NUM , or $ NUM per NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> average cost VERB a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit , also known as the firm ’s profit NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> expanding the equation for profit gives : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve ( VERB to the level of fixed costs they have VERB ) , in the long run when all costs are variable , they can choose to operate on any average cost curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the long - run average cost ( PROPN ) curve is actually based on a group of short - run average cost ( PROPN ) curves , each of which represents NUM specific level of fixed costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more ADV , the long - run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of scale can also be present across an entire firm , not just a large factory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN effect can VERB firms that become too large to run ADV , across the NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> firms that VERB their NOUN are often VERB to finding itself in the NOUN region , thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower output level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB this NOUN to read an article about the NOUN of the belief that banks can be “ too - big - to - VERB . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the total number of units VERB at that price is called the quantity demanded . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the quantity demanded is measured in millions of NOUN over some time period ( for example , per day or per year ) and over some geographic area ( like a state or a country ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like [ link ] , with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per NOUN on the vertical axis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( note that this is an exception to the normal rule in NOUN that the independent variable ( x ) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable ( y ) goes on the vertical . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> price is what the producer receives for selling NUM unit of a good or service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the price of gasoline rises , for example , it VERB profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand NOUN for oil reserves ; VERB for more oil ; VERB in more NOUN and oil NOUN to bring the oil to plants where it can be VERB into gasoline ; build new oil NOUN ; purchase additional NOUN and NOUN to VERB the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> again , price is measured in dollars per NOUN of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a supply curve is a ADJ NOUN of the relationship between price , shown on the vertical axis , and quantity , shown on the horizontal axis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the supply schedule and the supply curve are just NUM different ways of showing the same information . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . this common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at any other price , the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied , so the market is not in equilibrium at that price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the previous NOUN VERB how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the result was the demand curve and the supply curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for some — NOUN cars , NOUN in europe , and ADJ NOUN — the effect of a rise in income can be especially VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a product whose demand rises when income rises , and vice ADV , is called a normal good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a few NOUN to this pattern do exist . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as ADJ books , like this NUM , become more available , you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional VERB books . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if other factors ADJ to supply do change , then the entire supply curve will shift . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price , a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to the PROPN research center for people and the press , more and more people , especially ADJ people , are getting their news from ADJ and ADJ sources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the majority of u.s. adults now own NOUN or NOUN , and most of those americans say they use them in part to get the news . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> laws that government VERB to regulate prices are called price controls . <sent_end> <sent_begin> price controls come in NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> markets for labor have demand and supply curves , just like markets for goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law of demand VERB in labor markets this way : a higher NOUN or wage — that is , a higher price in the labor market — leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers , while a lower NOUN or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law of supply functions in labor markets , too : a higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied ; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied . <sent_end> <sent_begin> equilibrium in the labor market <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers VERB to hire at any given NOUN or wage rate , under the ADJ ADJ assumption . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a change in the wage or NOUN will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some was VERB in private companies or VERB to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building NOUN or mass NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some firms VERB their savings in their own businesses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , we will determine how the demand and supply model NOUN those who VERB to supply financial capital ( i.e. , savings ) with those who demand financial capital ( i.e. , borrowing ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those who save money ( or make financial investments , which is the same NOUN ) , whether individuals or businesses , are on the supply side of the financial market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods : now or in the future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists call this ADJ decision making because it involves decisions across time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike a decision about what to buy from the NOUN store , decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time , sometimes a long period . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple NOUN to other markets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the vision of the role of ADJ prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and VERB different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if PROPN had ADJ income or goods were free , then he could consume without limit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but PROPN , like all of us , faces a budget constraint . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN has a total of $ NUM to spend . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fourth t - NOUN is just to something to VERB when all his other NOUN are in the NOUN and NOUN only NUM additional NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is an example of the law of VERB marginal utility , which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the general rule can also be expressed as the ratio of the prices of the NUM goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the price of good NUM is divided by the price of good NUM , at the utility - NOUN point this will equal the marginal utility of good NUM divided by the marginal utility of good NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this rule , known as the consumer equilibrium , can be written in ADJ form : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conversely , when income falls , the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as defined in the chapter on demand and supply and again in the chapter on elasticity , goods and services are called normal goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity VERB of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , depending on PROPN ’s NOUN , a rise in income could cause consumption of NUM good to increase while consumption of the other good NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a choice like p means that a rise in income caused her quantity VERB of NOUN NOUN to decline , while a choice like q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of NOUN to decline . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this example , the higher price for NOUN NOUN would cause PROPN to buy a fewer NOUN for both reasons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the middle , close - to - vertical portion of the labor supply curve VERB the situation of a person who VERB to a higher wage by VERB about the same quantity of labor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a ADV - VERB supply curve for labor , which is the situation of high - wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still - higher wage by working fewer hours . <sent_end> <sent_begin> read the following clear it up feature for more on the number of hours the average person works each year . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN will compare the different choices along the budget constraint and choose the one that provides him with the highest utility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , he will compare the utility he would receive from a choice like point a , with consumption of $ NUM NUM in the present , NUM savings , and NUM future consumption ; point b , with present consumption of $ NUM , savings of $ NUM , and future consumption of $ NUM ; point c , with present consumption of $ NUM , savings of $ NUM , and future consumption of $ NUM ; or even choice d , with present consumption of NUM , savings of $ NUM , and future consumption of $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we tend to focus more on the loss than the gain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as loss NOUN , where a $ NUM loss NOUN us NUM times more than a $ NUM gain helps us , according to the economists daniel PROPN and PROPN PROPN in a famous NUM article in the journal PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN has NOUN for NOUN , as people tend to “ VERB ” the stock market by VERB more to losses than to gains . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur : ( 1 ) many firms produce identical products ; ( 2 ) many buyers are available to buy the product , and many sellers are available to sell the product ; ( 3 ) sellers and buyers have all ADJ information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold ; and ( NUM ) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions — in other words , there is free entry and exit into and out of the market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> total revenue and total costs for the NOUN NOUN , broken down into fixed and variable costs , are shown in [ link ] and also appear in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the horizontal axis shows the quantity of ADJ NOUN produced in NOUN ; the vertical axis shows both total revenue and total costs , measured in dollars . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> new firms may start production , as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> losses are the black NOUN that causes businesses to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a business is making losses in the short run , it will either keep VERB along or just VERB down , depending on whether its NOUN are VERB its variable costs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that , in the long run , VERB the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a NUM profit . to understand how short - run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will VERB in the long run , imagine the following situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the market is in long - run equilibrium , where all firms earn NUM economic profits producing the output level where p = PROPN = PROPN and p = NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> no firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for a VERB cost industry , as the market VERB , the old and new firms experience lower costs of production , which makes the new NUM - profit level VERB at a lower price than before . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , the industry and all the firms in it are VERB falling average total costs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this chapter , we explore the opposite extreme : monopoly . if perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price , monopoly is a market with no competition at all , and firms have complete market power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of monopoly , NUM firm produces all of the output in a market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since a monopoly faces no significant competition , it can charge any price it VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other is legal monopoly , where laws VERB ( or ADV limit ) competition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is an VERB NOUN or name for a particular good , like PROPN NOUN , PROPN cars , or the PROPN “ NOUN ” that appears on shoes and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> roughly NUM NUM NOUN are VERB with the u.s. government . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taken together , this combination of NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and trade secret law is called intellectual property , because it implies ownership over an idea , concept , or image , not a physical piece of property like a house or a car . <sent_end> <sent_begin> countries around the world have VERB laws to protect intellectual property , although the time periods and ADJ provisions of such laws vary across countries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> profits for the NOUN , like any firm , will be equal to total NOUN minus total costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the pattern of costs for the monopoly can be VERB within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm — that is , by using total cost , fixed cost , variable cost , marginal cost , average cost , and average variable cost . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , because a monopoly faces no competition , its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] VERB the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from [ link ] , and VERB NUM more NOUN : marginal profit is the NOUN of each additional unit sold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these NOUN , firms that could be described as ADV competitive ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> what VERB their behavior ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ competition involves many firms competing against each other , but selling products that are ADJ in some way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples include stores that sell different NOUN of NOUN ; NOUN or NOUN stores that sell different kinds of food ; and even products like NOUN NOUN or NOUN that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of NOUN and NOUN names . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADV competitive firm VERB a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] offers a NOUN that the demand curve as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat , because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it VERB at the VERB market price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , the demand curve , as faced by a NOUN , is the market demand curve , since a NOUN is the only firm in the market , and hence is downward VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new NOUN will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve VERB the average cost curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the long - term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this outcome is why perfect competition NOUN productive efficiency : goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , in ADJ competition , the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that VERB on the downward - VERB portion of the average cost curve , not at the very bottom of the PROPN curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> similarly , a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long - run average cost curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in such a setting , the market has room for only NUM firm , because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to VERB , and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a group of firms that have a formal agreement to VERB to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> see the following clear it up feature for a more in - depth analysis of the difference between the NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because of the NOUN of NOUN , which is the result of ADJ NOUN among firms , there is no single , generally - accepted theory of how NOUN behave , in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , economists use NOUN theory , a branch of NOUN that VERB situations in which NOUN must make decisions and then receive NOUN based on what other NOUN decide to do . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN theory has found widespread NOUN in the social PROPN , as well as in business , law , and military strategy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the result of this NOUN ’s NOUN is often that even though a and b could make the highest combined profits by VERB in producing a lower level of output and acting like a NOUN , the NUM firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only $ NUM each in profits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following clear it up feature VERB NUM NOUN NOUN in particular . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if NUM firm cuts its price to $ NUM , it will be able to sell only NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , if the NOUN VERB to raise prices , the other NOUN will not raise their prices , and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of sales . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a corporate NOUN occurs when NUM ADV separate firms combine to become a single firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM firm purchases another , it is called an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN may not look just like a NOUN , since the newly VERB firm may continue to be VERB under its former company name . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in an early NOUN of the law ’s power , the u.s. supreme court in NUM upheld the government ’s right to break up standard oil , which had controlled about NUM % of the country ’s oil NOUN , into NUM independent firms , including PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the PROPN antitrust act VERB NOUN and NOUN ( where the outcome would be to “ substantially VERB competition ” in an industry ) , price discrimination ( where different NOUN are charged different prices for the same product ) , and VERB sales ( where purchase of NUM product VERB the buyer to purchase some other product ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also in NUM , the federal trade commission ( PROPN ) was created to define more specifically what competition was ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are VERB for by the largest firms , typically the top NUM to NUM firms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for an explanation of how high market NOUN can create NOUN in an economy , refer to monopoly . say that the market for VERB broken NOUN NOUN in a certain city has NUM firms with the market NOUN shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s NOUN of total sales in that market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM - firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market NOUN of the NUM largest firms : in this case , NUM + NUM + NUM + NUM = NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , in the total market for all computer NOUN and services , including everything from NOUN to scientific programs , the PROPN share was only about NUM % in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADV defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a ADV defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . there are NUM especially important shifts VERB how markets are defined in recent decades : NUM centers on technology and the other centers on globalization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , these NUM shifts are VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> antitrust law includes rules against ADJ practices — practices that do not involve ADJ agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> antitrust cases involving ADJ practices are often controversial , because they VERB into specific NOUN or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if a product NOUN is selling to a group of NOUN who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the NOUN to demand a minimum NOUN price maintenance agreement , which would require the NOUN to sell for at least a certain minimum price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a minimum price contract is illegal because it would VERB competition among NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even if a NOUN was interested in a ADJ NOUN , the NOUN to a particular model VERB the NOUN from having the NOUN of VERB NUM from the numerous types available in the market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a related , but not identical , concept is called NOUN , where NUM or more products are sold as NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to VERB multiple products or services for a better price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a natural monopoly VERB a difficult challenge for competition policy , because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a natural monopoly VERB when average costs are VERB over the range of production that VERB market demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they calculated the average cost of production for the water or NOUN companies , added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn , and set the price for consumers ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this method was known as cost - plus regulation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture , in which the firms ADV being regulated end up VERB a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the NOUN industry was being regulated , for example , it suggested NOUN to the regulatory board , sent NOUN to argue with the board , provided most of the information on which the board made decisions , and offered well - paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> private markets , such as the cell NOUN industry , offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced , how they are produced , and who VERB them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> externalities can be negative or positive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you hate country music , then having it VERB into your house every night would be a negative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free NOUN would be a positive NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a market with no anti - pollution restrictions , firms can VERB of certain NOUN ADV free . <sent_end> <sent_begin> now imagine that firms which produce NOUN must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a NOUN , but also the broader costs to society of NOUN to health and other values caused by pollution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the firm is required to pay $ NUM for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a NOUN , production becomes more ADJ and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other laws required the NOUN of certain equipment — for example , on NOUN NOUN or on NOUN — to reduce pollution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these types of laws , which VERB ADJ quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control NOUN must be used , fall under the category of NOUN - and - control regulation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in effect , NOUN - and - control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by VERB anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and VERB up the u.s. environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a pollution charge gives a profit - VERB firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its NOUN — as long as the marginal cost of reducing the NOUN is less than the tax . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another application of ADJ NOUN occurred when the PROPN air act was VERB in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ law sought to reduce NOUN dioxide NOUN from electric power plants to half of the NUM levels out of concern that NOUN dioxide was causing acid NOUN , which VERB NOUN as well as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the definition of NOUN is a little ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> does it mean VERB on the ground , eating roots , and getting close to wild animals ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> no nation by itself can reduce NOUN of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to VERB the problem of global NOUN — not without the NOUN of other nations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another issue is the challenge of VERB NOUN , which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although a nation can protect NOUN within its own NOUN , no nation acting alone can protect NOUN around the world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN between economic output and the environment can be VERB with a production possibility frontier ( PROPN ) such as the one shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at NUM extreme , at a choice like p , a country would be VERB a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> depending on their different income levels and political NOUN , countries are likely to make different choices about ADJ efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is ADV on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB choice in a world of NOUN for more on these terms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> will private firms in a market economy under NOUN in research and technology ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a firm VERB a factory or VERB a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether VERB by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you learned in environmental protection and negative externalities , positive externalities are beneficial NOUN to a third party , or parties . consider the example of the big drug company , which is VERB its NOUN budget for the next year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists and scientists working for big drug have VERB a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after all , if the government is spending NOUN dollars to VERB public education , society should expect some kind of return on that spending . <sent_end> <sent_begin> again , economists like george PROPN have found that , across a variety of nations , the social rate of return on NOUN is also positive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , positive externalities exist from investment in education . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> intellectual property rights include NOUN , which give the NOUN the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the NOUN for a limited time , and NOUN laws , which give the NOUN an exclusive legal right over works of NOUN , music , NOUN / NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if a ADJ firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can VERB or sell that drug for NUM - NUM years , unless the firm with the patent grants NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> without a patent , the ADJ firm would have to face competition for any successful products , and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other institutions , such as the national PROPN of scientists and the national PROPN of PROPN , receive federal grants for ADJ projects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN and food research PROPN ( PROPN ) at the united states department of PROPN VERB federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN between government - funded NOUN , NOUN , and the private NOUN can VERB product innovation and create whole new industries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second main characteristic of a public good , that it is ADJ , means that when NUM person uses the public good , another can also use it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a private good like NOUN , if PROPN is eating the NOUN then PROPN can not also eat it ; that is , the NUM people are NOUN in consumption . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to explore these questions , let ’s start by focusing on a specific disease , NOUN - cell NOUN , and how it might affect NUM infected NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - cell NOUN is a genetic condition in which red blood cells , which are normally round , take on a NOUN - like shape ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB this NOUN with ADJ evolutionary psychologist david PROPN for an explanation of how a psychologist VERB evolution and how this approach VERB within the field of social science . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an allele is a specific version of a gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a sperm and egg fuse , their NUM chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with NUM pairs of chromosomes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by NUM gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a characteristic like PROPN PROPN , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this example , we will call the gene for PROPN PROPN “ b , ” and the gene for smooth PROPN “ b. ” PROPN PROPN is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from NUM parent ( PROPN ) or both parents ( PROPN ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN - cell NOUN is just NUM of many genetic disorders caused by the NOUN of NUM recessive genes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NOUN ( PROPN ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally VERB ADJ amino acids into ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if someone with this condition goes ADJ , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , NOUN , and increased risk of various ADJ disorders . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gene mutations provide NUM source of ADJ genes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a ADJ , permanent change in a gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while many mutations can be ADJ or ADJ , once in a while , a NOUN benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in another approach to gene - environment interactions , the field of NOUN looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> genes affect more than our physical characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , scientists have found genetic NOUN to a number of behavioral characteristics , VERB from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to NOUN ( for examples , see PROPN et al . , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , johnson , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ cells , which VERB neurons NUM to NUM , are traditionally thought to play a ADJ role to neurons , both ADV and ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ cells provide NOUN on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow ADJ communication , provide NOUN to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and VERB immune responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> neurons , on the other hand , serve as ADJ information NOUN that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a neuron ’s outer surface is made up of a ADJ membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it , while VERB larger or highly charged molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the neuron is a small information NOUN , and NOUN serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these signals are transmitted ADV across the PROPN and down a major extension from the PROPN known as the axon , which ends at multiple ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN contain ADJ vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical NOUN of the nervous system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in healthy individuals , the ADJ signal moves rapidly down the axon to the ADJ NOUN , where ADJ vesicles release neurotransmitters into the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is a very small space between NUM neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once neurotransmitters are released into the NOUN , they travel across the small space and bind with VERB receptors on the NOUN of an adjacent neuron . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ membrane VERB these NUM fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the NOUN and extracellular fluids being ADV different . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this difference in charge across the membrane , called the membrane potential , provides energy for the signal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with this NOUN of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if that charge VERB a certain level , called the threshold of NOUN , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . many additional NOUN open , causing a massive NOUN of NOUN ions and a huge positive NOUN in the membrane potential , the peak action potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the peak of the NOUN , the sodium NOUN close and the NOUN NOUN open . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because it is all or NOUN , the action potential is VERB , or VERB , at its full strength at every point along the axon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> much like the NOUN fuse of a NOUN , it does not VERB away as it VERB down the axon . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are chemicals that VERB a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , VERB its effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN , on the other hand , blocks or VERB the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN drugs are VERB to correct the specific neurotransmitter NOUN underlying a person ’s condition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it can be further VERB into the sympathetic and ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> his NOUN VERB , his heart rate and blood pressure increase , his bladder VERB , his liver releases glucose , and NOUN NOUN into his NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN of physiological changes , known as the fight or flight response , allows the body access to energy reserves and VERB sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the spinal cord is VERB in a particular segment , all lower NOUN are cut off from the brain , causing NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , the lower on the NOUN damage is , the fewer functions an VERB individual VERB . the NUM PROPN surface of the brain , known as the ADJ cortex , is very ADJ , characterized by a ADJ pattern of NOUN or NOUN , known as NOUN ( singular : PROPN ) , and NOUN , known as NOUN ( singular : PROPN ) , shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN and NOUN form important NOUN that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM NOUN are connected by a thick NOUN of ADJ fibers known as the PROPN NOUN , consisting of about NUM NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN allows the NUM NOUN to communicate with each other and allows for information being VERB on NUM side of the brain to be shared with the other side . <sent_end> <sent_begin> normally , we are not aware of the different roles that our NUM NOUN play in day - to - day functions , but there are people who come to know the NOUN and functions of their NUM NOUN quite well . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains the motor cortex , which is involved in VERB and VERB movement ; the ADJ cortex , which is responsible for higher - level cognitive functioning ; and PROPN ’s area , which is essential for language production . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the brain ’s ADJ lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains the ADJ cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as NOUN , temperature , and pain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the NOUN ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s area , important for speech NOUN , is also located here . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other areas of the PROPN areas of the NOUN , located ADP the ADJ cortex , include the thalamus and the ADJ system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the thalamus is a sensory NOUN for the brain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ system is made up of a number of different structures , but NUM of the most important are the NOUN , the NOUN , and the hypothalamus ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is an essential structure for learning and memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is involved in our experience of emotion and in VERB emotional meaning to our memories . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , henry PROPN PROPN ( PROPN PROPN ) was a ADJ - old man who experienced severe NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an attempt to control his NOUN , PROPN PROPN VERB brain NOUN to remove his NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN ( latin for “ black substance ” ) and the ADJ NOUN area ( PROPN ) are also located in the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter NOUN , and both are critical for movement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the medulla controls the automatic processes of the ADJ nervous system , such as NOUN , blood pressure , and heart rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word PROPN literally means “ NOUN , ” and as the name suggests , the PROPN serves to VERB the brain and spinal cord . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also is involved in VERB brain activity during sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> brain PROPN have learned how brain NOUN can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> increasingly , however , we are able to obtain that information using brain NOUN techniques on individuals who have not VERB brain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , we take a more in - depth look at some of the techniques that are available for VERB the brain , including techniques that rely on radiation , magnetic fields , or electrical activity within the brain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in magnetic NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) , a person is placed inside a machine that VERB a strong magnetic field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body ’s cells to move . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like neurotransmitters , hormones are chemical NOUN that must bind to a receptor in order to VERB their signal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the adrenal glands VERB ADP our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as NOUN ( NOUN ) and NOUN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the pancreas is an internal organ that VERB hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is VERB by extensive , strict NOUN designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution ’s administration , scientists , and community members ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their NOUN , we might use NOUN in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from VERB participants ’ responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in cases where NOUN is involved , participants must receive a full NOUN upon NOUN of the study — complete , ADJ information about the purpose of the experiment , how the data collected will be used , the reasons why NOUN was necessary , and information about how to obtain additional information about the study . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> whereas NOUN review research NOUN that involve human participants , animal experimental NOUN are VERB by an institutional animal care and use committee ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an PROPN consists of institutional NOUN , scientists , NOUN , and community members . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the sign — positive or negative — of the correlation NOUN indicates the direction of the relationship ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> put another way , it means that as NUM variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when NUM variable decreases so does the other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , correlation is limited because VERB the existence of a relationship VERB us little about cause and effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while variables are sometimes VERB because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a VERB variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN NOUN / crime rate example mentioned earlier , temperature is a ADJ variable that could account for the relationship between the NUM variables . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> often we read or hear about them and simply VERB the information as ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> or , we have a NOUN about how something works and then look for evidence to support that NOUN , VERB evidence that would VERB us our NOUN is false ; this is known as NOUN bias . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other times , we find ADJ NOUN based on the information that comes most easily to mind , even if that information is ADV limited . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM groups are designed to be the same except for NUM difference — experimental NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the experimental group VERB the experimental NOUN — that is , the treatment or variable being VERB ( in this case , violent NOUN images ) — and the control group does not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since experimental NOUN is the only difference between the experimental and control groups , we can be sure that any differences between the NUM are due to experimental NOUN rather than chance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by being ADJ to which child is in which group , we protect against those NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this situation is a single - ADJ study , meaning that NUM of the groups ( participants ) are ADJ as to which group they are in ( experiment or control group ) while the researcher who developed the experiment VERB which participants are in each group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to achieve this , we must pay attention to NUM important variables , or things that can be changed , in any experimental study : the independent variable and the dependent variable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an independent variable is VERB or controlled by the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a well - designed experimental study , the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if possible , we should use a random sample ( there are other types of NOUN , but for the purposes of this chapter , we will focus on random NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a random sample is a NOUN of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected . <sent_end> <sent_begin> random NOUN are VERB because if the sample is large enough we can be ADV sure that the VERB individuals are representative of the larger population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups , a statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are ADJ differences between the NUM groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a statistical analysis VERB how likely any difference found is due to chance ( and thus not ADJ ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN are NUM important NOUN that must be made with any type of data collection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the ability to ADV produce a given result . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the context of psychological research , this would mean that any NOUN or tools used to VERB data do so in consistent , ADJ ways . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior , focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to VERB any observations to the larger population as a whole . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB refers to the ability to apply the NOUN of a particular research project to larger NOUN of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> again , case studies provide ADJ amounts of information , but since the cases are so specific , the potential to apply what ’s learned to the average person may be very limited . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the greatest benefit of ADJ observation is the NOUN , or NOUN , of information collected ADV in a natural setting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ADJ NOUN , or NOUN , than we might achieve with other research NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> often , psychologists develop NOUN as a means of NOUN data . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN of questions to be VERB by research participants , and can be delivered as paper - and - NOUN NOUN , VERB ADV , or conducted ADV ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> generally , the survey itself can be completed in a short time , and the NOUN of VERB a survey makes it easy to VERB data from a large number of people . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when we test the same group of individuals ADV over an extended period of time , we are conducting ADJ research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ research is a research design in which data - NOUN is VERB ADV over an extended period of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , we may survey a group of individuals about their ADJ NOUN at age NUM , VERB them a decade later at age NUM , and then again at age NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others , such as NOUN and personal experience , the NOUN of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientific knowledge is ADJ : it is VERB in ADJ , ADJ evidence that can be observed time and time again , regardless of who is VERB . while behavior is ADJ , the mind is not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if someone is VERB , we can see behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> facts are ADJ NOUN , and NOUN are personal NOUN , NOUN , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through ADJ research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process of scientific research <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientific knowledge is VERB through a process known as the scientific method . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , ideas ( in the form of theories and NOUN ) are VERB against the real world ( in the form of ADJ observations ) , and those ADJ observations lead to more ideas that are VERB against the real world , and so on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a hypothesis is a ADJ NOUN about how the world will behave if our idea is correct , and it is often VERB as an if - then statement ( e.g. , if i study all night , i will get a passing NOUN on the test ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hypothesis is extremely important because it VERB the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN comes to represent the human NOUN ’s NOUN over the NOUN of life in the NOUN of true happiness ( PROPN , NUM ) ; in fact , the greek word NOUN means NOUN , and it is often represented as a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word psychology was VERB at a time when the concepts of NOUN and mind were not as clearly VERB ( green , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in most areas of psychology , this means earning a NOUN in a ADJ area of psychology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> literally , PROPN refers to a NOUN of philosophy degree , but here , philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per X . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different ADJ NOUN that would be VERB in a traditional college of liberal NOUN and NOUN . the requirements to earn a NOUN vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> individuals who VERB to become VERB ADJ psychologists have another NOUN for earning a ADJ degree , which is known as a PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a PROPN is a NOUN of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in VERB NOUN in ADJ psychology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN programs generally place less emphasis on research - oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the ADJ context ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> evolutionary psychology , and specifically , the evolutionary psychology of humans , has VERB a NOUN in recent decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more recently , the study of personality has taken on a more ADJ approach . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rather than VERB how personality VERB , research is focused on VERB personality traits , measuring these traits , and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that NUM trait NOUN are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> until then , you will be introduced to NUM of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN was an american social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after the PROPN , in NUM , a PROPN war criminal , PROPN PROPN , who was VERB of VERB mass NOUN , was put on trial . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and ADJ factors . this particular approach is known as the ADJ model ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> health psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy , education , NOUN , and research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some NOUN are also actively VERB in scientific research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional , social , ADJ , and health - related outcomes in individuals who are considered ADV healthy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) was a german scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his famous book VERB principles of physiological psychology was published in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> william james ( NUM – NUM ) was the first american psychologist who VERB a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> james was introduced to PROPN ’s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’s characteristics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to freud , the unconscious mind could be VERB through NOUN analysis , by NOUN of the first words that came to people ’s NOUN , and through ADV ADJ NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ theory focuses on the role of a person ’s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated ADJ psychology for several decades ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> john b. PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) was an ADJ american psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early ADJ century at PROPN PROPN university ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while PROPN and james were concerned with understanding conscious experience , PROPN thought that the study of consciousness was VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the skinner NOUN is a chamber that VERB the subject from the external environment and has a behavior NOUN such as a NOUN or a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the animal VERB the NOUN or NOUN , the NOUN is able to VERB a positive reinforcement of the behavior ( such as food ) or a punishment ( such as a NOUN ) or a ADJ NOUN ( such as a light ) that is VERB with either the positive reinforcement or punishment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN rogers ( NUM – NUM ) was also an american psychologist who , like PROPN , VERB the potential for good that exists within all people ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rogers used a ADJ technique known as NOUN - VERB therapy in helping his clients deal with ADJ issues that resulted in their seeking NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we might even describe consciousness as a NOUN that VERB from full awareness to a deep sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this pattern of temperature NOUN , which VERB every day , is NUM example of a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN is a biological NOUN that takes place over a period of about NUM hours . <sent_end> <sent_begin> our sleep - wake cycle , which is linked to our environment ’s natural light - dark cycle , is perhaps the most obvious example of a ADJ NOUN , but we also have daily NOUN in heart rate , blood pressure , blood sugar , and body temperature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the brain ’s NOUN mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the NOUN nucleus ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of light - sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the PROPN based on the amount of light present , allowing this internal NOUN to be VERB with the outside world ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these individual differences in ADJ patterns of activity are known as a person ’s NOUN , and research VERB that NOUN NOUN and night NOUN differ with regard to sleep regulation ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sleep regulation refers to the brain ’s control of VERB between sleep and NOUN as well as VERB this cycle with the outside world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> individuals who do VERB shift work are also likely to experience NOUN in ADJ cycles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or ADJ basis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a person may work from NUM NOUN to NUM NOUN on PROPN , NUM NOUN to NUM NOUN on PROPN , and NUM NOUN to NUM NOUN on PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ regulation of sleep is VERB by sleep NOUN following sleep NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sleep NOUN refers to the fact that a sleep - VERB individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall ADJ during subsequent opportunities for sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be VERB using NOUN ( PROPN ) , and different phases of sleep can be VERB using PROPN as well ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is a segment of a NOUN ( PROPN ) , a NOUN of several physical variables during sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> brain waves during rem sleep appear very similar to brain waves during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , non - rem ( PROPN ) sleep is VERB into NUM stages VERB from each other and from NOUN by characteristic patterns of brain waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first NUM stages of sleep are PROPN sleep , while the fifth and final stage of sleep is rem sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as an individual continues through stage NUM sleep , there is an increase in ADJ wave activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN waves are even lower frequency ( NUM – NUM hz ) , higher amplitude brain waves than NOUN waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is relatively easy to wake someone from stage NUM sleep ; in fact , people often report that they have not been ADJ if they are VERB during stage NUM sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in addition , the appearance of k - PROPN is often associated with stage NUM sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a k - complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , k - NOUN might serve as a NOUN to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> freud made NOUN between the NOUN content and the ADJ content of dreams . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN content is the actual content , or NOUN , of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ content , on the other hand , refers to the VERB meaning of a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> among a variety of ADJ evidence , john PROPN VERB research on ADJ dreams as an opportunity to better understand VERB in general . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of NOUN are maintained during a NOUN state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a ADJ NOUN , a person becomes aware of the fact that they are VERB , and as such , they can control the NOUN ’s content ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in VERB , or NOUN , the NOUN VERB in relatively complex behaviors VERB from VERB about to driving an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during periods of NOUN , NOUN often have their eyes open , but they are not ADJ to attempts to communicate with them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> night NOUN result in a sense of panic in the NOUN and are often VERB by NOUN and attempts to escape from the immediate environment ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although individuals VERB from night NOUN appear to be ADJ , they generally have no memories of the events that occurred , and attempts to VERB them are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ sleep NOUN occurs when an individual ’s NOUN becomes VERB during sleep , and air is VERB from entering the lungs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in central sleep NOUN , NOUN in signals sent from the brain that regulate NOUN cause periods of ADJ NOUN ( white , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most common NOUN for sleep NOUN involves the use of a special device during sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a continuous positive NOUN pressure ( PROPN ) device includes a NOUN that VERB over the NOUN ’s NOUN and mouth , which is connected to a NOUN that VERB air into the person ’s PROPN , VERB them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with NOUN can not VERB falling ADJ at ADJ times . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these sleep NOUN are often associated with NOUN , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle NOUN , and in some cases involves complete NOUN of the voluntary muscles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite VERB significant ADJ consequences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in individuals VERB with a substance use disorder , there is a ADJ pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological NOUN . physical NOUN involves changes in normal ADJ functions — the NOUN will experience NOUN from the drug upon NOUN of use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , a person who has psychological NOUN has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to VERB psychological distress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> drug NOUN includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in recent years , NOUN ( NOUN ) use has become increasingly widespread . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a type of NOUN that can be made from NOUN that are ADV available ( e.g. , NOUN containing PROPN , a compound found in many over - the - NOUN cold and NOUN NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> despite recent changes in laws designed to make VERB NOUN more difficult , NOUN continues to be an easily ADJ and relatively ADJ drug NOUN ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is most commonly used in the form of NOUN products like NOUN or VERB NOUN ; therefore , there is a ADJ interest in developing effective NOUN NOUN techniques . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to date , people have used a variety of NOUN NOUN NOUN in addition to various ADJ NOUN in an attempt to VERB their use of NOUN products . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in general , VERB NOUN programs may be effective in the short term , but it is ADJ whether these effects VERB ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> still , people VERB ADJ NOUN may be given NOUN to make NOUN from the drug less difficult . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a ADJ NOUN that is less ADJ than NOUN and similar drugs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN help people who previously VERB with ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN symptoms through the use of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is NUM of a class of drugs that results in ADJ NOUN in sensory and ADJ experiences ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some cases , NOUN experience ADJ visual NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when sensory information is VERB by a sensory receptor , NOUN has occurred . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it has been estimated that on a clear night , the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a NOUN NOUN NUM NOUN away ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under ADJ conditions , the hair cells ( the receptor cells of the inner ear ) can detect the NOUN of a NOUN NUM NOUN away ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is also possible for us to get NOUN that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness — these are called ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a stimulus VERB a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to VERB sensory receptors and VERB nerve NOUN to the brain : this is an absolute threshold . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bottom - up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , how we VERB those NOUN is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because participants were so focused on the number of times the white NOUN was passing the ball , they completely VERB out other visual information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> failure to VERB something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention is called PROPN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , marshall PROPN , donald PROPN , and PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) published the results of a ADJ study in which they demonstrated that individuals from western cultures were more ADJ to experience certain types of visual NOUN than individuals from non - western cultures , and vice ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM such NOUN that PROPN were more likely to experience was the PROPN - PROPN NOUN ( [ link ] ) : the lines appear to be different NOUN , but they are actually the same length . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form . <sent_end> <sent_begin> frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of PROPN ( hz ) , or cycles per second . <sent_end> <sent_begin> longer NOUN will have lower frequencies , and shorter NOUN will have higher frequencies ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> higher NOUN are associated with ADJ sounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is measured in terms of NOUN ( PROPN ) , a ADJ unit of sound intensity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a typical NOUN would VERB with NUM NOUN ; a rock NOUN might check in at NUM NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> light waves are transmitted across the NOUN and enter the eye through the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is the ADJ NOUN over the eye . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after passing through the NOUN , light VERB the lens , a ADJ , ADJ structure that serves to provide additional focus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is VERB from near or far objects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN cells , known as cones , are light - VERB cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cones are specialized types of NOUN that work best in ADJ light conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cones are very sensitive to ADJ detail and provide ADJ ADJ resolution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a point in the visual field called the ADJ NOUN : even when light from a small object is focused on the ADJ NOUN , we do not see it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we are not ADV aware of our ADJ NOUN for NUM reasons : first , each eye VERB a slightly different view of the visual field ; therefore , the ADJ NOUN do not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each of these NOUN types is ADV sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the ADJ theory of color vision , shown in [ link ] , all NOUN in the spectrum can be produced by VERB red , green , and blue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM types of cones are each ADJ to NUM of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the single VERB species of the PROPN group is the PROPN NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its NOUN - shaped leaves — unique among seed plants because they feature a ADJ NOUN pattern — turn yellow in NOUN and fall from the tree . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , the PROPN in NOUN and NOUN consists of NUM NOUN and NUM NOUN that look ADV identical . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , collectively the PROPN , are located inside the NOUN of NOUN and often display ADJ NOUN to attract NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> flowers VERB by NOUN are usually small , ADJ , and ADV ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> flower structure is very diverse , and NOUN may be singular , multiple , or VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> multiple VERB NOUN VERB a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN and the female NOUN are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the male reproductive organs , the NOUN ( collectively called the NOUN ) , VERB the central NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are composed of a thin NOUN called a NOUN and a sac - like structure called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN supports the NOUN , where the NOUN are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem ; in NOUN , vascular tissue is VERB in the stem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be ADJ ( like NOUN ) , or produce NOUN tissues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most NOUN produce pollen that is PROPN or PROPN , with NUM NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is possible , for example , to determine the type of NOUN VERB by a plant just from the flower ’s characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many NOUN or NOUN - VERB flowers secrete NOUN , which is a ADJ liquid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they also produce both ADJ pollen , for reproduction , and ADJ pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ seeds come from plants that were traditionally VERB in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a technique in which NUM or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through dna analysis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell NOUN though a pollen tube : an extension of a cell within the pollen NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sperm of modern NOUN lack NOUN , but in NOUN and the PROPN , the sperm still possess NOUN that allow them to VERB down the pollen tube to the female NOUN ; however , they are VERB in a pollen NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most animals reproduce ADV , and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the body plan refers to the NOUN of an animal , determined by developmental cues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all animals are NOUN that VERB energy from food . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ( a ) black bear is an NOUN , eating both plants and animals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> next , the NOUN VERB further cell division and cellular NOUN during a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this leads to the formation of the next developmental stage , the PROPN , in which the future digestive cavity is formed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> different cell layers ( called NOUN layers ) are formed during NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these genes that determine animal structure are called “ ADJ genes , ” and they contain dna sequences called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the animal genes containing NOUN sequences are specifically referred to as PROPN genes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan , such as the number of body NOUN of an animal , the number and NOUN of NOUN , and animal head - tail NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the animals that display ADJ NOUN develop NUM NOUN layers , an inner layer ( NOUN ) and an outer layer ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these animals are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have a non - living layer between the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV ADJ , ADJ NOUN can be further divided into NUM groups based on differences in their early embryonic development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN include NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN include more complex animals such as NOUN but also some simple animals such as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recent evidence has VERB this view of the development of the NOUN of PROPN , however , and the theory remains under debate . another distinction between NOUN and NOUN is the method of NOUN formation , beginning from the NOUN stage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of most PROPN is formed through a process called ADV , meaning that during development , a solid mass of the NOUN VERB apart and forms the ADJ opening of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN differ in that their NOUN forms through a process called ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is due to the ADJ angle of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN undergo ADJ NOUN , where the NOUN NOUN are either parallel or ADJ to the polar axis , resulting in the NOUN of the cells between the NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the time before the PROPN period is known as the PROPN period ( from about NUM NUM years ago to NUM NUM years ago ) , the final period of the late PROPN PROPN era ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is believed that early animal life , termed PROPN NOUN , evolved from NOUN at this time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , ADJ events , such as ADJ NOUN and NOUN VERB that VERB life , can result in ADJ losses of diversity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such periods of mass extinction ( [ link ] ) have occurred ADV in the evolutionary record of life , VERB some genetic lines while creating room for others to VERB into the ADJ NOUN left behind . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the end of the ADJ period ( and the PROPN era ) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in earth ’s history , a loss of roughly NUM percent of the ADJ species at that time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of sponges <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the ADJ sponges takes the shape of a NOUN with a large central cavity , the PROPN , VERB the inside of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> water can enter into the PROPN from numerous NOUN in the body wall . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second crucial cells in sponges are called PROPN ( or NOUN ) , named for the fact that they move throughout the NOUN in an NOUN - like NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have a variety of functions : VERB nutrients from NOUN to other cells within the NOUN , giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction ( which remain in the NOUN ) , VERB ADJ sperm from NOUN to eggs , and VERB into more - specific cell types . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN includes animals that show ADJ or ADJ NOUN and are ADJ , that is , they develop from NUM embryonic layers . nearly all ( about NUM percent ) NOUN are marine species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB here to follow the life cycle of the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all NOUN show the presence of NUM membrane layers in the body that are derived from the NOUN and NOUN of the embryo . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the outer layer ( from PROPN ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from NOUN ) is called the PROPN and lines the digestive cavity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> between these NUM membrane layers is a non - living , ADV - like PROPN connective layer . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN perform extracellular NOUN in which the food is taken into the NOUN cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN cavity has only NUM opening that serves as both a mouth and an NOUN , which is termed an ADJ digestive system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment , and between cells in the NOUN with water in the ADJ cavity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is called NOUN or “ first mouth . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , solid groups of cells split from the NOUN or inner NOUN layer to form a central ADJ layer of cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this layer VERB into a NOUN and then VERB ADV to form the NOUN ; this ADJ NOUN is hence termed NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN are ADV known as NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most species of phylum PROPN are marine , ADV ADJ or bottom NOUN , with an estimated NUM species known . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , PROPN have been VERB in ADJ and terrestrial NOUN as well . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the zygote then develops into a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some ADJ species , a NOUN NOUN may develop inside the young NOUN , from a series of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ form , ADV shaped like a NOUN NOUN , VERB tissues from the young NOUN for survival before VERB into the adult - like NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> additionally , a NOUN - like organ called a PROPN , which VERB ADJ NOUN - like NOUN , is present in many species , and serves to VERB or VERB food . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN ( also known as the NOUN ) is the ADJ epidermis in NOUN ; VERB NOUN are specialized to secrete a ADJ and hard ADJ shell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN includes ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these animals are found in marine , terrestrial , and NOUN NOUN , but a presence of water or NOUN is a critical factor for their survival , especially in terrestrial NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> circular as well as ADJ muscles are located interior to the epidermis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ ADJ NOUN , VERB in the epidermis and VERB from the NOUN , called PROPN / PROPN are present in every segment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN show the presence of a true NOUN , derived from embryonic NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the name “ PROPN ” means “ ADJ NOUN ” ( in the greek , “ PROPN ” means “ joint ” and “ PROPN ” means “ NOUN ” ) ; it ADV describes the ADJ number of NOUN included in this phylum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB the animal NOUN with an estimated NUM percent of known species included in this phylum and many NOUN yet ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional NOUN of the body and presence of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unlike that of the PROPN , the head and NOUN of most NOUN is VERB to form a NOUN ( [ link ] ) , which is covered by a NOUN called the NOUN , thus producing a body structure of NUM PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have a ADJ NOUN that is VERB by NOUN ADV the animal increases in size . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ stages — PROPN and PROPN — are seen in the early development of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN is also seen in the early development of NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second pair of NOUN is known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some species , like sea NOUN , an additional pair of NOUN , called NOUN , is present between the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN are so named VERB to their ADJ skin ( from the greek “ PROPN ” meaning “ ADJ ” and “ PROPN ” meaning “ skin ” ) , and this phylum is a collection of about NUM described living species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are ADV marine organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sea NOUN ( [ link ] ) , sea NOUN , sea NOUN , NOUN dollars , and ADJ NOUN are all examples of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN in the phylum PROPN share NUM key features that appear at some stage of their development : a NOUN , a ADJ ADJ nerve cord , ADJ NOUN , and a post - ADJ tail . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some groups , some of these traits are present only during embryonic development . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ ADJ nerve cord VERB from NOUN that VERB into a ADJ tube during development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , it is located ADJ to the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the post - ADJ tail is a posterior NOUN of the body , VERB beyond the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the tail contains ADJ elements and muscles , which provide a source of NOUN in aquatic species , such as fishes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ members of PROPN are the NOUN , named for their NOUN - like shape . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are only a few NOUN long and are usually found VERB in NOUN at the bottom of ADJ ADJ and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> vertebrates are members of the NOUN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> vertebrates display the NUM characteristic features of the NOUN ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN PROPN includes at least NUM species of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are NOUN - like NOUN that live on the ocean floor and VERB on dead NOUN , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN PROPN includes approximately NUM – NUM or more species of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are similar to PROPN in size and shape ; however , NOUN possess some ADJ elements . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN lack VERB NOUN and bone , as do the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have well - developed sense organs that aid them in VERB NOUN , including a ADJ sense of NOUN and NOUN , with the ADJ perhaps the most sensitive of any animal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organs called NOUN of PROPN allow NOUN to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things , including their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN has only been observed in aquatic or ADJ animals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> water is drawn over NOUN that are located in NOUN covered and VERB by a ADJ , ADJ NOUN called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many bony fishes also have a NOUN bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the NOUN of the fish . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bony fishes are further divided into NUM ADJ NOUN : PROPN ( ray - VERB fishes ) and PROPN ( lobe - ADJ fishes ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an estimated NUM species VERB NOUN , a group of NOUN that belong to the order PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although they are vertebrates , a complete lack of NOUN leads to their NOUN to NOUN in appearance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN protects the embryo from mechanical NOUN and supports NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN stores ADJ NOUN produced by the embryo and also VERB respiration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in mammals , membranes that are homologous to the extra - embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the key differences between the NOUN , PROPN , and NOUN are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal NOUN behind each eye ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> temporal NOUN are post - ADJ NOUN in the skull that allow muscles to expand and VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have no temporal NOUN , NOUN have NUM , and NOUN have NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , or skin , includes ADJ glands with various functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ glands produce a ADJ mixture called NOUN that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ glands are located over most of the body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ glands , or NOUN glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ glands produce NOUN that is used to VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while male NOUN and NOUN possess ADJ glands , male NOUN do not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most mammals have ADJ teeth , meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just NUM type and shape of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most mammals are NOUN , meaning that they have NUM sets of teeth in their lifetime : ADJ or “ NOUN ” teeth , and permanent teeth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other vertebrates are NOUN , that is , their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are found primarily in PROPN , though the NOUN is found in north america . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN include the PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN NOUN ( [ link ] ) , and several other species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the feathers on a wing are ADJ , so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them , reducing the NOUN on the wing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> flight feathers are ADJ , which affects NOUN over them and provides some of the NOUN and VERB force required for flight ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM types of flight feathers are found on the NOUN , primary feathers and secondary feathers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> secondary feathers are located ADV to the body , VERB to the NOUN portion of the wing and provide NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce NOUN produced by NOUN resistance during flight . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they create a smooth , ADJ surface so that air moves ADV over the NOUN ’s body , allowing for efficient flight . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather , PROPN VERB into NUM groups : NUM included the long - ADJ ADJ NOUN , such as PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second group , ADJ NOUN called NOUN , includes birds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this course of evolution is suggested by NOUN between ADJ NOUN and birds , specifically in the structure of the NOUN and NOUN bones , as well as the presence of the NOUN , formed by the NOUN of the NOUN . NUM important fossil of an animal intermediate to NOUN and birds is PROPN , which is from the PROPN period ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the extinction of PROPN , modern birds became the dominant NOUN , with a large radiation occurring during the PROPN era . <sent_end> <sent_begin> referred to as PROPN ( “ new birds ” ) , modern birds are now classified into NUM groups , the PROPN ( “ old PROPN ” ) or NOUN , a group of ADJ birds including NOUN , NOUN , PROPN , and NOUN , and the PROPN ( “ new PROPN ” ) , which includes all other birds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN - NOUN remain largely ADJ NOUN until more fossil evidence becomes available . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ known NOUN - like mammals with a relatively ADJ fossil record is PROPN ( although some researchers do not agree that PROPN was a ADJ - ADJ ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of this NOUN have been VERB to approximately NUM NUM years ago . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plant tissue systems fall into NUM of NUM general types : ADJ tissue , and permanent ( or non - ADJ ) tissue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells of the ADJ tissue are found in NOUN , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ tissue cells are either ADJ or ADV ADJ , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ tissues consist of NUM types , based on their location in the plant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> apical NOUN contain ADJ tissue located at the NOUN of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length . <sent_end> <sent_begin> lateral NOUN VERB growth in NOUN or NOUN in a VERB plant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they VERB into NUM main types : ADJ , vascular , and ground tissue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue VERB water , NOUN , and sugars to different parts of the plant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plant stems , whether above or below ground , are characterized by the presence of nodes and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nodes are points of attachment for leaves , ADJ roots , and flowers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the stem region between NUM nodes is called an PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ NOUN is usually found in the PROPN — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ ( NOUN ) of the shoot contains the apical NOUN within the apical NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN cells also provide support to the plant , but unlike NOUN cells , many of them are dead at NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM types of NOUN cells : fibers and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NUM types conduct water and are dead at NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN cells with thick secondary cell walls that are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> water moves from NUM NOUN to another through regions on the side walls known as NOUN , where secondary walls are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although still ADJ at NOUN , the nucleus and other cell components of the NOUN - tube cells have VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN cells are found ADP the NOUN - tube cells , providing them with metabolic support . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN cells contain more NOUN and mitochondria than the NOUN - tube cells , which lack some cellular organelles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some plant species have modified stems that are especially VERB to a particular NOUN and environment ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a modified stem that VERB ADV ADV and has nodes and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> vertical NOUN may arise from the NOUN on the NOUN of some plants , such as NOUN and ferns . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are a type of NOUN that runs above the ground and produces new NOUN plants at nodes at varying NOUN : NOUN are an example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are modified stems that may store NOUN , as seen in the NOUN ( PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some ADJ NOUN of stems are NOUN and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are ADJ , VERB NOUN that enable a plant ( like a NOUN or NOUN ) to seek support by VERB on other surfaces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are modified branches VERB as ADJ NOUN that protect the plant ; common examples include NOUN , PROPN NOUN and NOUN ’s VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have a NOUN root system , while NOUN have a ADJ root system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN root system has a main root that VERB down ADV , and from which many smaller lateral roots arise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are a good example ; their NOUN roots usually break off when trying to VERB these NOUN , and they can VERB another shoot from the remaining root ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the epidermis provides protection and helps in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> root NOUN , which are NOUN of root ADJ cells , increase the surface area of the root , greatly VERB to the NOUN of water and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ substance called PROPN is present on the walls of the ADJ cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ region , known as the PROPN NOUN , forces water and NOUN to cross the plasma membranes of ADJ cells instead of VERB between the cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB that only materials required by the root pass through the PROPN , while ADJ substances and pathogens are generally VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each leaf typically has a leaf NOUN called the NOUN , which is also the ADJ part of the leaf . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> leaves that do not have a NOUN and are directly attached to the plant stem are called ADJ leaves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> within each leaf , the vascular tissue forms NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the arrangement of NOUN in a leaf is called the NOUN pattern . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and NOUN differ in their patterns of NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> leaves may be simple or compound ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a simple leaf , the NOUN is either completely ADJ — as in the NOUN leaf — or it has NOUN , but the separation does not reach the NOUN , as in the NOUN leaf . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a compound leaf , the leaf NOUN is completely divided , forming NOUN , as in the NOUN tree . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( common name “ PROPN plant ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN compound leaves take their name from their NOUN - like appearance ; the NOUN are VERB along the NOUN , as in NOUN leaves ( PROPN PROPN . ) , or the leaves of NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , or NOUN trees . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in practical terms , therefore , water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and ADJ water ( at atmospheric pressure and ADJ temperature ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> water potential is VERB by the greek NOUN NOUN ( NOUN ) and is expressed in units of pressure ( pressure is a form of energy ) called PROPN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the potential of ADJ water ( NOUN NOUN ) is , by NOUN of definition , VERB a value of NUM ( even though ADJ water contains NOUN of potential energy , that energy is VERB ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> leaves are covered by a ADJ NOUN on the outer surface that VERB the loss of water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> regulation of NOUN , therefore , is achieved primarily through the opening and NOUN of NOUN on the leaf surface . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADV - named NOUN are protein - based receptors responsible for VERB the ADJ response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like all plant NOUN , NOUN consist of a protein portion and a light - VERB portion , called the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN ( also known as NOUN ) are specialized NOUN that contain NOUN NOUN and VERB downward in response to gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are found in NOUN and in specialized cells of the root NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the effect of NOUN was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid NOUN of NOUN to developing plant NOUN in culture stimulated their growth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the stimulating growth factor was found to be PROPN , a hormone that VERB NOUN ( cell division ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> almost NUM naturally occurring or ADJ NOUN are known to date . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is associated with fruit NOUN , flower NOUN , and leaf fall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is unusual because it is a ADJ gas ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they act ADV at the site of NOUN , and can also be transported to other tissues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN promote seed NOUN in some species and VERB lateral apical development in the absence of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN also play a role in the establishment of NOUN , a ADJ association of plant roots and fungi . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that ADV VERB the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves , which VERB for the next NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant VERB to continuous mechanical stress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when trees VERB in the NOUN , for example , growth is usually ADJ and the NOUN VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plants require only light , water and about NUM elements to support all their ADJ needs : these NUM elements are called essential nutrients ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for an element to be VERB as essential , NUM NOUN are required : 1 ) a plant can not complete its life cycle without the element ; 2 ) no other element can perform the function of the element ; and 3 ) the element is directly involved in plant NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil , which serves as a natural NOUN for land plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> soil is the outer ADJ layer that covers the surface of earth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> soil quality is a major NOUN , along with climate , of plant distribution and growth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order to describe the motion of an object , you must first be able to describe its position — where it is at any particular time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more ADV , you need to VERB its position relative to a ADJ reference frame . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> note that the distance between NUM positions is not the same as the distance VERB between them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> distance VERB is the total length of the path VERB between NUM positions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> distance has no direction and , thus , no sign . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the motion of falling objects , as covered in problem - solving PROPN for NUM - dimensional PROPN , is a simple NUM - dimensional type of NOUN motion in which there is no horizontal movement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , we consider NUM - dimensional NOUN motion , such as that of a NOUN or other object for which air resistance is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most important fact to remember here is that NOUN along ADJ NOUN are independent and thus can be VERB ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this fact was discussed in NOUN in NUM NOUN : an NOUN , where vertical and horizontal NOUN were seen to be independent . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when adding NOUN , we have been ADJ to VERB that the velocity is relative to some reference frame . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are called relative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the velocity of an NOUN relative to an air mass is different from its velocity relative to the ground . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to understand this , we need a working definition of force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> our ADJ definition of force — that is , a push or a NOUN — is a good place to start . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we know that a push or NOUN has both magnitude and direction ( therefore , it is a vector quantity ) and can vary ADV in each regard . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> force is a push or VERB that can be defined in terms of various standards , and it is a vector having both magnitude and direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> newton ’s second law of motion is closely related to newton ’s first law of motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it ADV states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these will be discussed in more detail in later NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for now , we will define friction as a force that VERB the motion past each other of objects that are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] ( b ) shows how vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net force , <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this means the NOUN VERB a large ADJ force on the gas in the NOUN NOUN chamber , and the gas therefore VERB a large reaction force forward on the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this reaction force is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a common NOUN that NOUN VERB themselves by VERB on the ground or on the air behind them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is called a free - body diagram . <sent_end> <sent_begin> only forces are shown on free - body NOUN , not acceleration or velocity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eventually a large enough stress to the material will cause it to break or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ strength is the VERB stress that will cause permanent NOUN or NOUN of a material . PROPN ’s law <sent_end>
<sent_begin> calculate the ADJ acceleration of a point NUM NOUN from the axis of an ADJ VERB at <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for ideal banking , the net external force VERB the horizontal ADJ force in the absence of friction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the components of the normal force n in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the ADJ force and the weight of the car , respectively . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN unit for time , the second ( PROPN s ) , has a long history . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for many years it was defined as NUM / NUM of a mean ADJ day . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN units are part of the ADJ system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ system is ADJ for scientific and NOUN NOUN because the units are VERB by factors of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scientists are ADV trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> physics is concerned with describing the interactions of energy , matter , space , and time , and it is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms VERB every phenomenon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially VERB the realm of physics . physics VERB to describe the function of everything around us , from the movement of ADJ charged particles to the motion of people , cars , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the kinetic theory of gases , on the other hand , is a model in which a gas is viewed as being composed of atoms and molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses — thus , we picture them ADV to understand what our NOUN VERB us about the behavior of gases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a law uses ADJ language to describe a ADJ pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> often , a law can be expressed in the form of a single ADJ equation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> modern physics itself consists of the NUM revolutionary theories , relativity and quantum NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these theories deal with the very ADJ and the very small , respectively . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> average speed , however , is very different from average velocity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> average speed is the distance VERB divided by VERB time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> average acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes , <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of earth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the acceleration of free - falling objects is therefore called the acceleration due to gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the acceleration due to gravity is constant , which means we can apply the NOUN NOUN to any falling object where air resistance and friction are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> science is based on observation and experiment — that is , on measurements . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , let us say that you are measuring the length of standard computer paper . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how big is the NOUN in something you calculate by NOUN or division ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the measurements going into the NOUN have small NOUN ( a few percent or less ) , then the method of adding NOUN can be used for NOUN or division . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this method says that the percent NOUN in a quantity calculated by NOUN or division is the sum of the percent NOUN in the items used to make the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an understanding of acceleration , for example , is crucial to the study of force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> our formal study of physics begins with NOUN which is defined as the study of motion without VERB its causes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word “ NOUN ” comes from a greek term meaning motion and is related to other english words such as “ NOUN ” ( NOUN ) and “ PROPN ” ( the study of human motion ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> displacement , velocity , acceleration , and force , for example , are all vectors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> note that in our example , we have only NUM vectors , so we have VERB VERB NOUN NOUN to tail . <sent_end> <sent_begin> step NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> draw an NOUN from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the NOUN , or the sum , of the other vectors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the head of the vector d VERB the head of the vertical vector . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this characteristic is true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> vector addition is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> vectors can be added in any order . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a + b = b + a . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a + b = b + a . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { " a + b = b + a " } { } ( <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well — you get the same result whether you add NUM + NUM NUM + NUM size NUM { " NUM + NUM " } { } <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the head - to - tail method of adding vectors involves VERB the first vector on a graph and then VERB the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the final vector . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> experience suggests that an object at rest will remain at rest if left alone , and that an object in motion tends to slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what newton ’s first law of motion states , however , is the following : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the quantities that might differ between them are volume and density . <sent_end> <sent_begin> section PROPN <sent_end> <sent_begin> newton ’s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest , or , if in motion , remains in motion at a constant velocity unless VERB on by a net external force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is also known as the law of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we will see , the basic forces are all thought to act through the exchange of ADJ carrier particles , and the characteristics of the basic forces are determined by the types of particles VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> action at a distance , such as the gravitational force of earth on the PROPN , is explained by the existence of a force field rather than by “ physical contact . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> friction is a force that is around us all the time that VERB relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move ( which you have discovered if you have ever tried to VERB on NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while a common force , the behavior of friction is actually very ADJ and is still not completely understood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we will therefore study not only motion along curves , but also the forces that cause it , including gravitational forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some ways , this chapter is a NOUN of dynamics : newton 's laws of motion as we study more NOUN of newton ’s laws of motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this chapter VERB with the ADJ form of ADJ motion , ADJ circular motion , motion in a circular path at constant speed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> studying this topic illustrates most concepts associated with ADJ motion and leads to the study of many new topics we group under the name rotation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you take the NOUN - go - round to be your frame of reference because you VERB together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in that non - ADJ frame , you feel a ADJ force , named ADJ force ( not to be VERB with ADJ force ) , trying to VERB you off . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you must VERB on ADV to VERB the ADJ force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the bodies we are VERB with tend to be large . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB the situation we VERB that the body acts as if its entire mass is concentrated at NUM specific point called the center of mass ( PROPN ) , which will be further VERB in linear momentum and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for NUM bodies having NOUN PROPN size NUM { m } { } and m m size NUM { m } { } with a distance r r size NUM { r } { } between their centers of mass , the equation for newton ’s universal law of NOUN is f = g m m r NUM , f = g m m r NUM , size NUM { f = g { { ital " m m " } over { r rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } } } { } where f f size NUM { f } { } is the magnitude of the gravitational force and g g size NUM { g } { } is a NOUN factor called the gravitational constant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> energy is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can ADV define energy as the ability to do work , VERB that in some circumstances not all energy is available to do work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the association of energy with work , we begin the chapter with a discussion of work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this expression is called the work - energy NOUN , and it actually VERB in general ( even for forces that vary in direction and magnitude ) , although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the displacement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN implies that the net work on a system VERB the change in the quantity NUM m v NUM NUM m v NUM size NUM { { { NUM } over { NUM } } ital " NOUN " rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> where i and f VERB initial and final values . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this equation is a form of the work - energy NOUN for conservative forces ; it is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> remember that this VERB to the extent that all the forces are conservative , so that friction is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> law of conservation of energy <sent_end> <sent_begin> energy , as we have noted , is VERB , making it NUM of the most important physical quantities in nature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law of conservation of energy can be stated as follows : total energy is constant in any process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it may change in form or be transferred from NUM system to another , but the total remains the same . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we have VERB some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from NUM system to another . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most energy sources on earth are in fact stored energy from the energy we receive from the sun . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we sometimes refer to this as ADJ energy , or electromagnetic radiation , which includes visible light , ADJ , and ADJ radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nuclear energy comes from processes that convert ADJ amounts of mass into energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the rate at which the body uses food energy to VERB life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the total energy NOUN rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate ( PROPN ) and is divided among various systems in the body , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil , although natural gas and ADJ contributions are increasing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ forms of energy are those sources that can not be used up , such as water , NOUN , ADJ , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> about NUM % of our energy comes from ADJ fossil NOUN — oil , natural gas , NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the importance of momentum , unlike the importance of energy , was recognized early in the development of classical physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> momentum was VERB so important that it was called the “ quantity of motion . ” newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum : the net external force VERB the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> using NOUN , this law is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] below illustrates how a particle VERB ADV from another implies that its target is massive and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> experiments seeking evidence that NOUN make up protons ( NUM type of particle that makes up nuclei ) VERB high - energy electrons off of protons ( nuclei of hydrogen atoms ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> electrons ADV VERB straight ADV in a manner that VERB a very small and very ADJ particle makes up the NOUN — this observation is considered nearly direct evidence of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an elastic NOUN is one that VERB internal kinetic energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but the internal kinetic energy is NUM after the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN in which the objects VERB together is sometimes called a perfectly inelastic NOUN because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other type of inelastic NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , such a NOUN reduces internal kinetic energy to the minimum it can have while still VERB momentum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perfectly inelastic PROPN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a system is said to be in stable equilibrium if , when VERB from equilibrium , it experiences a net force or NOUN in a direction opposite to the direction of the displacement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NOUN at the bottom of a NOUN will experience a VERB force when VERB from its equilibrium position . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first step is to determine whether or not the system is in ADJ equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this condition is always the case when the acceleration of the system is NUM and ADJ rotation does not occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before we can consider the rotation of PRON other than a point mass like the NUM in [ link ] , we must extend the idea of ADJ NOUN to all types of objects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to expand our concept of ADJ NOUN , we define the moment of NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN are the law of conservation of ADJ momentum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conservation laws are as ADJ as they are important . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> density , as you will see , is an important characteristic of substances . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is crucial , for example , in determining whether an object VERB or NOUN in a fluid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the pressure is transmitted ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this phenomenon is called PROPN ’s principle , because it was first clearly stated by the french NOUN and scientist PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) : a change in pressure applied to an ADJ fluid is transmitted ADJ to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this means that the upward force on the bottom of an object in a fluid is greater than the downward force on the top of the object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a net upward , or ADJ force on any object in any fluid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ forces between molecules of the same type are called ADJ forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can , for example , be held in open NOUN because ADJ forces hold the molecules together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM important phenomenon related to the relative strength of ADJ and ADJ forces is capillary action — the tendency of a fluid to be raised or VERB in a ADJ tube , or capillary tube . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this action causes blood to be drawn into a small - diameter tube when the tube VERB a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure , called ADJ pressure , which is normally in the range of NUM to NUM NUM PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the circulation of fluid in the eye is VERB , it can lead to a NOUN in pressure , a condition called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how does the body regulate blood flow ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the physics of fluids in motion — fluid dynamics — allows us to answer these and many other questions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows both types of flow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ flow is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ flow , or NOUN , is characterized by NOUN and VERB that VERB layers of fluid together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( PROPN NOUN PROPN ) NOUN r NUM NOUN l . <sent_end> <sent_begin> q = ( NOUN NOUN PROPN ) NOUN r NUM NOUN l . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { q = { { NOUN ( p rsub { size NUM { NUM } } - p rsub { size NUM { NUM } } NOUN ) NOUN r rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } over { NUM NOUN l } } } { } <sent_end> <sent_begin> this equation describes ADJ flow through a tube . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is sometimes called PROPN ’s law for ADJ flow , or simply PROPN ’s law . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this motion is called a random NOUN and is illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> diffusion is the movement of substances due to random thermal molecular motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> fluids , like fish NOUN or NOUN entering NOUN NOUN , can even VERB through NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when you VERB a ADJ NOUN in PROPN NOUN , the water moves out of your body into the lower - concentration region in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , NOUN is the transport of any other molecule through a ADJ membrane due to its concentration difference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both NOUN and NOUN are used by the kidneys to VERB the blood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> heat transfer is maintained by temperature differences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of heat transfer — the movement of heat energy from NUM place or material to another — are ADJ throughout the universe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> heat from ADP earth ’s surface is brought to the surface in flows of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> } <sent_end> <sent_begin> { } the PROPN scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is an absolute temperature scale defined to have 0 k at the lowest possible temperature , called absolute NUM . the official temperature unit on this scale is the PROPN , which is VERB k , and is not VERB by a degree sign . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thermal expansion joints like these in the PROPN PROPN PROPN in new PROPN allow NOUN to change length without VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : PROPN , PROPN PROPN ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> the expansion of alcohol in a NOUN is NUM of many commonly VERB examples of thermal expansion , the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ air rises because its volume increases , which causes the ADJ air ’s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air , causing a ADJ ( upward ) force on the ADJ air . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN ’s number <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is sometimes ADJ to work with a unit other than molecules when measuring the amount of substance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN ( VERB NOUN ) is defined to be the amount of a substance that contains as many atoms or molecules as there are atoms in exactly NUM NOUN ( NUM NOUN ) of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the actual number of atoms or molecules in NUM NOUN is called PROPN ’s number ( PROPN ) ( PROPN ) size NUM { NOUN ( n rsub { size NUM { a } } NOUN ) } { } , in recognition of ADJ scientist PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> 0 NOUN c } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> critical pressure is the minimum pressure needed for liquid to exist at the critical temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] NOUN representative critical temperatures and pressures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN size NUM { ital " PROPN " } { } NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> vapor pressure is defined as the pressure at which a gas VERB with its solid or liquid phase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> vapor pressure is created by ADJ molecules that break away from the liquid or solid and enter the gas phase . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when we say NOUN , we really mean relative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> relative NOUN VERB us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we define percent relative NOUN as the ratio of vapor density to VERB vapor density , or <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN from solid to vapor phase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you may have VERB that NOUN can VERB into thin air without a NOUN of liquid water , or the NOUN of NOUN NOUN in a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> heat transfer by radiation occurs when NOUN , ADJ radiation , visible light , or another form of electromagnetic radiation is VERB or absorbed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an obvious example is the NOUN of the earth by the sun . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is a negative feedback ( NUM in which a change produces an effect that VERB that change ) between NOUN and heat transfer ; greater temperatures VERB more water to form more NOUN , which reflect more radiation back into space , reducing the temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the often mentioned NOUN effect is directly related to the variation of the earth ’s NOUN with radiation type ( see the figure given below ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for providing temperatures ADJ for life on earth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the most important things we can do with heat transfer is to use it to do work for us . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such a device is called a heat NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> car NOUN and NOUN NOUN that generate NOUN are examples of heat NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for NOUN , both are shown starting from the same point a . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the upper curve VERB at point b is an ADJ process — that is , NUM in which temperature is VERB constant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the gas VERB like an ideal gas , as is often the case , and if no phase change occurs , then PROPN = n PROPN PROPN = n NOUN size NUM { ital " PROPN " = ital " n PROPN " } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the already familiar direction of heat transfer from ADJ to cold is the basis of our first version of the second law of thermodynamics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates the operation of the common NUM - NOUN gasoline NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM steps shown complete this heat NOUN ’s cycle , VERB the gasoline - air mixture back to its original condition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN cycle shown in [ link ] ( a ) is used in NUM - NOUN internal NOUN NOUN , although in fact the true PROPN cycle NOUN do not correspond exactly to the NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> stated in terms of ADJ processes , the second law of thermodynamics has a third form : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these are what we call NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is an overall property of a system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it does not VERB the NOUN of the system , such as the order in which NOUN and NOUN occur or which NOUN are NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what do an ocean NOUN , a child in a NOUN , the NOUN inside a speaker , a NOUN , atoms in a NOUN , the motion of NOUN NOUN , and the NOUN of NOUN all have in common ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> they all VERB — - that is , they move back and ADV between NUM points . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many systems VERB , and they have certain characteristics in common . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each ADJ NOUN of the NOUN takes the same time as the previous NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we define ADJ motion to be a motion that VERB itself at ADJ time NOUN , such as VERB by the NOUN NOUN or by an object on a spring moving up and down . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the time to complete NUM NOUN remains constant and is called the period t t size NUM { t } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the driving force VERB energy into the system at a certain frequency , not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would VERB if there were no driving and no VERB force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most of us have VERB with NOUN involving an object supported on an elastic NOUN , something like the NOUN ball VERB from a NOUN in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> imagine the NOUN in the figure is your NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most ADJ and ADJ wave to imagine is the familiar water wave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more ADV , a wave is a disturbance that VERB , or moves from the place it was created . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for water waves , the disturbance is in the surface of the water , perhaps created by a rock VERB into a NOUN or by a NOUN VERB the surface ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such a wave is called a ADJ wave or NOUN wave ; in such a wave , the disturbance is ADJ to the direction of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , in a ADJ wave or ADJ wave , the disturbance is parallel to the direction of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows an example of a ADJ wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows NUM identical waves that VERB exactly out of phase — that is , ADV aligned NOUN to NOUN — producing ADJ ADJ interference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the disturbances are in the opposite direction for this NOUN , the resulting amplitude is NUM for ADJ ADJ interference — the waves completely VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fixed ends of NOUN must be nodes , too , because the NOUN can not move there . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word PROPN is used to VERB the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> standing waves on NOUN have a frequency that is related to the NOUN speed PROPN size NUM { v rsub { size NUM { NOUN } } } { } of the disturbance on the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because hearing is NUM of our most important senses , it is interesting to see how the physical properties of sound correspond to our perceptions of it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> hearing is the perception of sound , just as vision is the perception of visible light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but sound has important NOUN beyond hearing . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> note that because only the ratio NOUN / PROPN PROPN / PROPN is given ( and not the actual NOUN ) , this result is true for any NOUN that differ by a factor of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NUM PROPN sound is ADV as ADJ as a NUM PROPN sound , a NUM NOUN sound is half as ADJ as a NUM NOUN sound , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it should be noted at this point that there is another NOUN scale in use , called the sound pressure level , based on the ratio of the pressure amplitude to a reference pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this scale is used particularly in NOUN where sound VERB in water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> interference NOUN VERB contrast between objects and NOUN by VERB a reference NOUN of light upon the light VERB from the sample . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since light from the NOUN and objects differ in phase , there will be different amounts of ADJ and ADJ interference , producing the VERB contrast in final intensity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> apart from the NOUN microscope , the variations of NOUN discussed so far in this section are available as NOUN to fairly standard NOUN or as ADJ variations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the next level of NOUN is provided by commercial ADJ NOUN , which use the extended ADJ region shown in [ link ] ( b ) to obtain NUM - dimensional images rather than NUM - dimensional images . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here , only a single plane or region of focus is identified ; out - of - focus regions above and below this plane are VERB out by a computer so the image quality is much better . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we use specific terms for the NOUN in any system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the lowest ADJ frequency is called the fundamental , while all higher ADJ frequencies are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all ADJ frequencies are integral NOUN of the fundamental , and they are collectively called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> normal human hearing VERB frequencies from NUM to NUM hz , an ADJ range . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sounds below NUM hz are called NOUN , whereas those above NUM hz are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> neither is perceived by the ear , although NOUN can sometimes be felt as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> very few measuring NOUN are capable of observations over a range of a NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the perception of intensity is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at a given frequency , it is possible to VERB differences of about NUM NOUN , and a change of NUM PROPN is easily VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another major use of NOUN in medical NOUN is to detect motion and determine velocity through the PROPN shift of an NOUN , known as PROPN - VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this technique is used to VERB ADJ NOUN , measure blood velocity , and detect NOUN in blood vessels , for example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how do we know there are NUM types of electric charge ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> when various materials are VERB together in controlled ways , certain NOUN of materials always produce NUM type of charge on NUM material and the opposite type on the other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , in all situations the total amount of charge is always constant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADV VERB law of nature is called the law of conservation of charge . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other words , the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other substances , such as glass , do not allow charges to move through them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> electrons and ions in NOUN are bound in the structure and can not move easily — as much as NUM size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { " NUM " } } } { } times more ADV than in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to build a useful macroeconomic model , we need a model that shows what VERB total supply or total demand for the economy , and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this model is called the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN will explain aggregate supply , aggregate demand , and the equilibrium between them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the NOUN of higher profits will VERB them to expand production . the slope of an as curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below potential gdp , which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully VERB its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at these relatively low levels of output , levels of unemployment are high , and many NOUN are running only part - time , or have closed their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this demand is determined by a number of factors , but NUM of them is the price level — recall though , that the price level is an index number such as the gdp NOUN that measures the average price of the things we buy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the aggregate demand ( ad ) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] VERB an aggregate demand ( ad ) curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just like the aggregate supply curve , the horizontal axis shows real gdp and the vertical axis shows the price level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the long run , however , producers are limited to producing at potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , what we have been VERB the as curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( PROPN ) curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the vertical line at potential gdp may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( PROPN ) curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM measure of this is output per worker or gdp per capita . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over time , productivity VERB so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the university of PROPN VERB a survey of consumer NOUN and VERB an index of consumer NOUN each NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the survey results are then reported at PRON , which break down the change in consumer NOUN among different income levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ad / as model can be used to VERB both say ’s law that supply creates its own demand and keynes ’ law that demand creates its own supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider the NUM zones of the PROPN curve as identified in [ link ] : the keynesian zone , the neoclassical zone , and the intermediate zone . keynes , neoclassical , and intermediate zones in the aggregate supply PROPN the equilibrium PROPN , in the keynesian zone at the far left of the PROPN curve , small shifts in ad , either to the right or the left , will affect the output level PROPN , but will not much affect the price level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , consider the intermediate zone of the PROPN curve in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the ad curve VERB this portion of the PROPN curve at an equilibrium point like PROPN , then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in VERB directions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at PROPN in the [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> keynes believed that the economy would tend to VERB in a ADJ gap , with its ADJ unemployment , for a significant period of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the same way ( though not shown in the figure ) , if ad increases , the economy could experience an inflationary gap , where demand is VERB to push the economy past potential output . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a NOUN , the economy experiences inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ income : for most people , the single most powerful NOUN of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take - home pay , also known as ADJ income , which is income after taxes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , prices and wages are “ ADJ , ” making it difficult to VERB the economy to full employment and potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> keynes VERB NUM particular reason why wages were ADJ : the NOUN argument . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this argument points out that , even if most people would be willing — at least ADV — to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline , a market - oriented economy has no obvious way to VERB a plan of ADJ wage NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a key concept in keynesian economics is the expenditure NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the expenditure NOUN is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of gdp , but that spending is powerful . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the keynesian theory VERB that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even VERB beyond potential gdp , the economy is at greater risk for inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB NUM years of british data and did find that NOUN between unemployment and inflation , which became known as a PROPN curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a ADJ PROPN curve , and the following work it out feature shows how the pattern appears for the united states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> keynesian NOUN VERB that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if aggregate demand was originally at PROPN in [ link ] , so that the economy was in recession , the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from PROPN to PROPN , where the economy would be at potential gdp and full employment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run NOUN in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and keynesian economics is more useful for VERB the macroeconomic short run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let 's consider the NUM neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be VERB in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the importance of potential gdp in the long run <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM NOUN of neoclassical economists holds that the NOUN of wages and prices in the NOUN might be quite rapid indeed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can , using all information available to them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an economy where most people have rational expectations , economic NOUN may happen very quickly . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as inflation VERB , so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nominal interest rate is VERB of the real rate , plus an expected inflation factor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> expected inflation also VERB economists about how the public views the direction of the economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fighting unemployment or PROPN explained in unemployment , unemployment can be divided into NUM categories : ADJ unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment , which is the sum of ADJ and structural unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ unemployment results from NOUN in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential gdp — giving potential employers less incentive to hire . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each approach , keynesian and neoclassical , has its NOUN and NOUN . the short - term keynesian model , built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price NOUN , does a sound job of VERB many NOUN and why ADJ unemployment rises and falls . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by focusing on the short - run NOUN of aggregate demand , keynesian economics NOUN VERB the long - term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at this point , you should have ADV in mind the main goals of NOUN from PROPN to economics PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . you should also understand keynesian and neoclassical NOUN for macroeconomic analysis and how these NOUN can be VERB in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( ad / as ) model . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN — literally trading NUM good or service for another — is highly ADJ for trying to VERB the NOUN in a modern ADJ economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an economy without money , an exchange between NUM people would involve a double NOUN of NOUN , a situation in which NUM people each want some good or service that the other person can provide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if an NOUN VERB a pair of shoes , this NOUN must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an economy with inflation , money VERB some buying power each year , but it remains money . third , money serves as a unit of account , which means that it is the NOUN by which other values are measured . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , an NOUN may charge $ NUM to VERB your tax return . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gold , NOUN , ADJ NOUN , NOUN , and even NOUN NOUN have been used as money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although these items are used as NOUN money , they also have a value from use as something other than money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gold , for example , has been used throughout the NOUN as money although today it is not used as money but rather is VERB for its other NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money , economists offer broader NOUN of money based on NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to how quickly a financial NOUN can be used to buy a good or service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , cash is very liquid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> m1 money supply includes those NOUN that are very liquid such as cash , ADJ ( demand ) deposits , and NOUN ’s NOUN m2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes m1 plus savings and time deposits , NOUN of deposits , and money market funds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> m1 money supply includes NOUN and currency in circulation — the NOUN and bills that VERB in an economy that are not held by the u.s. treasury , at the federal reserve bank , or in bank NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> closely related to currency are ADJ deposits , also known as demand deposits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are the amounts held in VERB accounts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to VERB in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are VERB together and VERB in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another NOUN of m2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ NUM ) NOUN of deposit ( NOUN ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the NOUN has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , VERB from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in short , all these types of m2 are money that you can VERB and spend , but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in m1 [ link ] should help in VERB the relationship between m1 and m2 . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> until you pay the credit card bill , you have effectively VERB money from the credit card company . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a ADJ card , you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some “ ADJ NOUN ” used for specific purposes , like long - distance NOUN NOUN or making purchases at a NOUN NOUN and NOUN , are not really all that ADJ , because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places . in short , credit NOUN , NOUN NOUN , and ADJ NOUN are different ways to move money when a purchase is made . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then VERB them at a later date . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to VERB them cash NOUN costs are the costs associated with finding a NOUN or a borrower for this money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , banks lower transactions costs and act as financial NOUN — they bring NOUN and NOUN together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a credit union is a ADJ financial institution that its members own and run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if you own a home , this is also considered an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a debt or something you VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many people borrow money to buy homes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates a ADJ and ADJ balance NOUN for the safe and secure bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the NUM - NOUN NOUN of the balance NOUN , with the t - shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “ assets ” and “ PROPN , ” it is sometimes called a t - account . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these bonds are an NOUN for banks in the same way that loans are an NOUN : the bank will receive a NOUN of payments in the future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in our example , the safe and secure bank holds bonds worth a total value of $ NUM NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the final entry under assets is reserves , which is money that the bank VERB on hand , and that is not VERB out or VERB in bonds — and thus does not lead to interest payments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federal reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of NOUN ’ money on “ reserve , ” which means either in their NOUN or VERB at the federal reserve bank . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the risk of an ADV high level of loan NOUN can be especially difficult for banks because a bank ’s NOUN , ADV the deposits of its NOUN , can be VERB quickly , but many of the bank ’s assets like loans and bonds will only be VERB over years or even decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN - NOUN time NOUN — a bank ’s NOUN can be VERB in the short term while its assets are VERB in the long term — can cause severe problems for a bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , imagine a bank that has VERB a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate , but then VERB interest rates rise substantially . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in making decisions about the money supply , a central bank VERB whether to raise or lower interest rates and , in this way , to influence macroeconomic policy , whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the central bank is also responsible for VERB all or part of the nation ’s banking system to protect bank NOUN and VERB the health of the bank ’s balance NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the answer is the PROPN of the federal reserve board of governors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in early NUM , PROPN PROPN PROPN , shown in [ link ] became the first woman to hold this post . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN has been described in the media as “ perhaps the most ADJ PROPN NOUN in history . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a NOUN in economics from PROPN university , PROPN has VERB NOUN at PROPN , the PROPN school of economics , and most recently at the university of california at PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in money and banking , we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ on hand ” is a NOUN of a NOUN because , while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank , the majority are held in the bank ’s account at the federal reserve , and their purpose is to cover ADJ NOUN by NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the national credit union administration ( PROPN ) VERB credit unions , which are ADJ banks owned and run by their members . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are over NUM credit unions in the u.s. economy , though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federal reserve also has some responsibility for VERB financial institutions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to protect against bank runs , congress has put NUM strategies into place : deposit insurance and the NOUN of last NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure NOUN in a bank do not lose their money , even if the bank goes ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most important function of the federal reserve is to conduct the nation ’s monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> article NUM , section NUM of the u.s. constitution gives congress the power “ to VERB money ” and “ to regulate the value ADV . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> as part of the NUM legislation that created the federal reserve , congress VERB these powers to the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> where did the federal reserve get the $ NUM NUM that it used to purchase the bonds ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> a central bank has the power to create money . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a result of the panic , the federal reserve was founded to be the “ NOUN of last NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the event of a bank run , sound banks , ( banks that were not ADJ ) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the PROPN ’s NOUN “ NOUN ” to VERB the bank run . the interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the NOUN rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( they are so named because loans are made against the bank ’s ADJ loans “ at a NOUN ” of their face value . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall that the specific interest rate the PROPN NOUN is the federal funds rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federal reserve has , since NUM , established its target federal funds rate in NOUN of any open market NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this example uses a short - run upward - VERB keynesian aggregate supply curve ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the original equilibrium during a recession of NOUN occurs at an output level of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in late NUM , as the u.s. economy VERB with recession , the federal reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near - NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with the recession still ADJ , the PROPN decided to VERB an ADJ and ADJ policy known as ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the purchase of long - term government and private NOUN - VERB NOUN by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> similarly , ADJ businesses and consumers may be ADJ to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms ’ sales and employees ’ jobs are more ADJ in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN occurs when the rate of inflation is negative ; that is , instead of money having less purchasing power over time , as occurs with inflation , money is worth more . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if velocity is constant over time , then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left - hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will ADV lead to the same percentage rise in nominal gdp — although this change could happen through an increase in inflation , or an increase in real gdp , or some combination of the NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way , then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by NUM , central banks in NUM countries , including PROPN , brazil , canada , PROPN , PROPN , mexico , new PROPN , spain , PROPN , PROPN , and the united PROPN faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ exception is the federal reserve in the united states , which does not practice inflation - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , the law VERB the federal reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . economists have no final NOUN on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , from NUM to NUM during what was known as the “ NOUN - ADJ ” NOUN , the u.s. stock market , which is measured by the PROPN PROPN industrial index ( which includes NUM very large companies from across the u.s. economy ) , nearly VERB in value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of NUM from NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these rates of increase were clearly not ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy ; that is , the view of monetary policy within an economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> exchange rates and international capital flows VERB the international NOUN of monetary policy , and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of financial capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the problem of the zero percent interest rate lower bound <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with these NOUN ADV noted , most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national NOUN in which both people and firms need to convert from NUM currency to another when selling , buying , VERB , borrowing , VERB , or VERB across national NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the market in which people or firms use NUM currency to purchase another currency is called the foreign exchange market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> financial investments that cross international NOUN , and require VERB currency , are often divided into NUM categories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> foreign direct investment ( PROPN ) refers to purchasing a firm ( at least NUM percent ) in another country or starting up a new NOUN in a foreign country <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in NUM the ADJ NOUN - VERB company PROPN bought the u.s. NOUN - NOUN PROPN - PROPN for $ NUM NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to make this purchase of a u.s. firm , PROPN would have to supply NOUN ( the currency of PROPN ) to the foreign exchange market and demand u.s. dollars . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most people and firms who are VERB a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank , and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as NOUN , then trade the foreign exchange . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called the NOUN market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this means that when VERB the exchange rates between NUM countries ( in this case , the united states and canada ) , the NOUN ( or NOUN ) of NUM country ( the u.s. dollar for this example ) indicates the NOUN ( or VERB ) of the other currency ( which in this example is the ADJ dollar ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( source : federal reserve economic data ( PROPN ) ( a ) PROPN ; ( b ) X ) the bottom graph shows the exchange rate from u.s. dollars to ADJ dollars since NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this example shows how a stronger PROPN VERB exports by the french firm , because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales NOUN earned in another country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from the point of view of the u.s. economy , the example also shows how a ADJ u.s. dollar VERB exports . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> exchange rates would VERB around less , too . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the economist PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) , for example , wrote a defense of VERB exchange rates in NUM in his book PROPN and freedom : being in favor of VERB exchange rates does not mean being in favor of ADJ exchange rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when we support a free price system [ for goods and services ] at home , this does not VERB that we favor a system in which prices VERB ADV up and down . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ central bank could VERB its exchange rate in NUM ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in foreign exchange markets , the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a country VERB to alter the market exchange rate , it faces a number of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate , it then can not at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign NOUN in exchange rates , then it must face the issue of how it will VERB its reserves of foreign currency . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a central bank ends up in a situation where it is ADV creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like u.s. dollars or NOUN , to hold as reserves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> holding large reserves of other NOUN has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not VERB to VERB such reserves without limit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as PROPN taxes , named after james PROPN , the NUM PROPN NOUN in economics who proposed such a tax in a NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term NOUN investment while VERB long - term foreign direct investment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> countries can also use regulation to VERB certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to VERB their funds from a country . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the choice depends both on how well a nation ’s central bank can VERB a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation ’s firms and banks can VERB to different exchange rate policies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a national economy that does a fairly good job at VERB the NUM main economic goals of growth , low inflation , low unemployment , and a ADJ balance of trade will probably do just VERB most of the time with any exchange rate policy ; conversely , no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that ADV VERB at VERB these goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , a ADJ currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems , such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> government spending covers a range of services provided by the federal , state , and local governments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the federal government VERB more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it VERB in a year , it runs a budget surplus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taxes also vary with ADJ status , family size , and other factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the marginal tax rates ( the tax that must be paid on all ADJ income ) for a single NOUN range from NUM % to NUM % , depending on income , as the following clear it up feature VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the third - largest source of federal tax revenue , as shown in [ link ] is the corporate income tax . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the common name for corporate income is “ profits . ” over time , corporate income tax NOUN have VERB as a share of gdp , from about NUM % in the 1960s to an average of NUM % to NUM % of gdp in the first decade of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> having discussed the revenue ( taxes ) and NOUN ( spending ) side of the budget , we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus , which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year , which VERB october NUM and ends september NUM of the next year . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not ADV VERB by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates , fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is referred to as VERB out , where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates , which reduces business investment and household consumption . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be VERB to the appropriate agencies to VERB the programs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the time to get the projects started is often called the implementation VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at this point , you may VERB about the federal reserve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , can the federal reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates , or in this case , to prevent interest rates from rising ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the PROPN education system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> programs for early childhood education , like the federal head start program , are VERB at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> government also offers substantial support for NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors , then a budget deficit may be VERB by a trade deficit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some countries , this pattern of a ADJ deficits has set the stage for international financial investors first to VERB their funds to a country and cause an NOUN of its exchange rate and then to VERB their funds out and cause a NOUN of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the differences in economic statistics and other measures of well - being , substantial though they are , do not fully capture the reasons for the ADJ differences between countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV from the neoclassical NOUN of growth , NUM additional NOUN are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth VERB : NOUN , NOUN , industrial structure , and institutions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> geographic and ADJ differences <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this combination of technology , human capital , and physical capital , combined with the NOUN of a market - oriented economic context , VERB an extremely powerful NOUN to growth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> challenges faced by these middle - income countries are a NOUN of government economic controls that for political reasons can be VERB only ADV over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unemployment rates in the nations of europe have typically been higher than in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , before the start of the great recession , the u.s. unemployment rate was NUM % , compared with NUM % in france , NUM % in germany , and NUM % in PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in europe , which VERB back to the 1970s , is typically VERB to the fact that european economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that VERB firms from VERB and ADJ workers from taking jobs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB the natural rate of unemployment is ADJ in theory but difficult in practice . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the economies of europe VERB with high levels of trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the north american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) , the united states , canada , and mexico VERB themselves to reduce trade barriers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least ADV beneficial to the economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be VERB eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a trade surplus , you may remember , exists when a nation ’s exports VERB its imports . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so , in order for a trade deficit to VERB to a trade surplus , a nation ’s exports must rise and its imports must fall . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall from the chapter choice in a world of NOUN that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the question each country or company should be VERB when it VERB is this : “ what do we give up to produce this good ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> it should be no NOUN that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from choice in a world of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if PROPN focuses its resources on producing NOUN , its labor , land and financial resources can not be used to produce other goods such as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> given their current production levels , if the united states can trade an amount of NOUN fewer than NUM NOUN and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than NUM NOUN , it will gain from trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with trade , the united states can consume more of both goods than it did without NOUN and trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( recall that the chapter <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if mexico VERB to produce more NOUN without trade , it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce NOUN production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if mexico , instead , produces more shoes and then VERB for NOUN made in the united states , where the opportunity cost of producing NOUN is lower , mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of NOUN in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , when the united states VERB in its comparative advantage of NOUN production and NOUN for shoes produced in mexico , international trade allows the united states to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of NOUN production in mexico . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain ADJ economic , social , and cultural interests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the world trade organization ( PROPN ) is committed to VERB barriers to trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the world ’s nations meet through the PROPN to VERB how they can reduce barriers to trade , such as tariffs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they make imports more expensive for consumers , VERB imports . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in recent years large , flat - NOUN NOUN imported from china have faced a NUM % NOUN rate . another way to control trade is through NOUN NOUN , which are ADJ NOUN on the quantity of products that can be imported . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , during the early 1980s , the reagan administration imposed a NOUN on the NOUN of japanese NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar , as detailed in [ link ] and illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in brazil , without trade , the equilibrium price of sugar is NUM NOUN per NOUN and the equilibrium output is NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when there is no trade in the united states , the equilibrium price of sugar is NUM NOUN per NOUN and the equilibrium quantity is NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> specifically for the strong nuclear force , PROPN proposed that a previously ADJ particle , now called a NOUN , is VERB between NOUN , VERB the force between them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates how a NOUN would carry a force between a NOUN and a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN are not only a useful tool for VERB interactions at the quantum mechanical level , they are also used to calculate NOUN of interactions , such as their NOUN and probability of occurring . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN was NUM of the theorists who developed the field of quantum PROPN ( PROPN ) , which is the quantum NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN has been ADV successful in describing electromagnetic interactions on the ADJ scale . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> several NOUN related to an underlying NOUN VERB from an NOUN of these particle characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that the carrier particles are called NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first mentioned in patterns in PROPN VERB more NOUN , a NOUN is a particle with NUM or an ADJ value of ADJ NOUN ( such as s = NUM , NUM , NUM , PUNCT s = NUM , NUM , NUM , PUNCT size NUM { s = NUM , PROPN , PROPN , ` " . " <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , the NOUN ( NOUN NUM size NUM { NOUN } { } ) was discovered , and a third family of NOUN emerged as seen in [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> theorists quickly proposed NUM more NOUN NOUN called top ( t ) or NOUN and bottom ( b ) or NOUN to keep the number of NOUN the same as the number of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and in NUM , the NOUN ( <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is beyond the NOUN of this NOUN to go into more detail on the types of NOUN and NOUN interactions that VERB the ADJ particles , but the theory ( quantum NOUN or PROPN ) is very self - consistent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so successful have PROPN and the NOUN theory been that , taken together , they are called the standard model . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even more extreme are the NOUN and NOUN at which gravity is thought to VERB with the other forces in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most ADJ and least VERB by experiment are NOUN , NUM of which is called PROPN theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN that are NUM NOUN NUM m NUM NOUN NUM m size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { - " NUM " } } ` m } { } in scale and act like NUM - dimensional ADJ NOUN and are also proposed to VERB all particles , forces , and space itself . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the energy of NOUN , the carrier particles of the weak force would become ADJ and identical to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he then found that all but the ADJ NOUN have a red shift in their hydrogen NOUN that is proportional to their distance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the explanation is that there is a ADJ red shift due to the expansion of space itself . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the photon wavelength is VERB in NOUN from the source to the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many aspects of general relativity have been VERB ADV , some of which are better than science NOUN in that they are ADJ but true . <sent_end> <sent_begin> quantum gravity is the theory that VERB with particle exchange of NOUN as the mechanism for the force , and with extreme conditions where quantum NOUN and general relativity must both be used . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a good theory of quantum gravity does not yet exist , but NUM will be needed to understand how all NUM forces may be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> black NOUN NOUN are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bodies , like the earth or the sun , have what is called an escape velocity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if an object moves straight up from the body , starting at the escape velocity , it will just be able to escape the gravity of the body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the greater the acceleration of gravity on the body , the greater is the escape velocity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> supporting this is the fact that very ADJ NOUN are more likely to have ADV ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of the ADV ADJ NOUN , and hence among the ADJ , are known as NOUN and VERB as much or more energy than a normal NOUN but from a region less than a light year across . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN energy NOUN may vary in times less than a year , so that the energy - VERB region must be less than a light year across . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the motion of NOUN in NOUN and the motion of NOUN in NOUN VERB that there is about NUM times as much mass as in the ADJ objects we can see . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADV observed non - ADJ matter is called dark matter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why is dark matter a problem ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this means that you can in principle travel an ADJ distance in any direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a universe that is closed is called ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means that if you travel far enough in any direction , you will return to your starting point , ADJ to VERB the earth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in ADJ NOUN because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such NOUN objects are thus called massive ADJ NOUN objects , or PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to date , a few NOUN have been observed , but not ADV in ADJ NOUN , nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these are called ADV VERB massive particles , or NOUN , and would also be NOUN , thus VERB ADV with normal matter , except through NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM proposed group of PROPN would have NOUN several NOUN of magnitude greater than NOUN and are sometimes called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others are called NOUN and would have NOUN about NUM NOUN NUM NUM NOUN NUM size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { - " NUM " } } } { } that of an electron mass . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are materials with a NOUN of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are familiar to the general public because of their practical NOUN and have been mentioned at a number of points in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is ADJ interference along the lines shown ( a NOUN in NUM NOUN ) from similar sound waves VERB there simultaneously . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN forms a disturbance called a ADJ NOUN , a ADJ interference of sound created by an object moving ADV than sound . <sent_end> <sent_begin> inside the NOUN , the interference is mostly ADJ , and so the sound intensity there is much less than on the NOUN wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an early NOUN is a relatively simple , large - scale version of the electron gun . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the van de PROPN ( named after the ADJ NOUN ) , which you have likely seen in physics NOUN , is a small version of the ones used for nuclear research since their NOUN for that purpose in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for more , see [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> still limited by ADJ magnetic field NOUN , NOUN need to be very large at very high NOUN , since the NOUN of a high - energy particle ’s NOUN is very large . <sent_end> <sent_begin> radiation caused by a magnetic field VERB a charged particle ADJ to its velocity is called NOUN radiation in NOUN of its importance in these NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN radiation has a characteristic spectrum and polarization , and can be recognized in ADJ rays , VERB large - scale magnetic fields acting on ADJ and charged particles in deep space . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now , let ’s look at what happens with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> u.s. sugar farmers are likely to argue that , if only they could be protected from sugar imported from brazil , the united states would have higher domestic sugar production , more jobs in the sugar industry , and american sugar farmers would receive a higher price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while the united states economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates — according to the bureau of labor statistics , from spring NUM to late NUM , the unemployment rate VERB from NUM % to NUM % ; it has since VERB back to NUM % in spring NUM — the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the number of u.s. jobs VERB from NUM NUM in NUM to NUM NUM in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ADV VERB jobs in the specific industry being protected but , for NUM reasons , it costs jobs in other ADJ industries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry , they ADV have less money to spend on goods from other industries , and so jobs are lost in those other industries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM concern is that while globalization may be VERB high - skilled , high - wage workers in the united states , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , high - skilled u.s. workers ADV benefit from increased sales of ADJ products like NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN in which the united states has a comparative advantage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , low - skilled u.s. workers must now VERB against extremely low - wage workers worldwide for making ADJ products like NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN refers to selling goods below their cost of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> anti - ADJ laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by VERB tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if free trade meant the NOUN of life itself , then even economists would convert to NOUN PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> while globalization — and economic activity of all kinds — can VERB environmental NOUN , it seems quite possible that , with the appropriate NOUN in place , the environmental NOUN of trade can be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the race to the bottom NOUN of global environmental NOUN runs like this . <sent_end> <sent_begin> profit - seeking ADJ companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards , thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the united nations was unable to agree to this . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( PROPN ) , was established in NUM to provide a NOUN in which nations could come together to VERB NOUN in tariffs and other barriers to trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the PROPN was transformed into the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for the united states , perhaps the best - known ADJ trading agreement is the north american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the united states also VERB in some less - prominent ADJ trading agreements , like the PROPN PROPN PROPN , which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries , and a free trade agreement with PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what is a function ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> a function describes a relationship . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes the relationship is a definition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the concept of slope is very useful in economics , because it measures the relationship between NUM variables . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a positive slope means that NUM variables are ADV related ; that is , when x increases , so does y , or when x decreases , y decreases also . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line rises . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN we have discussed so far are called line NOUN , because they show a relationship between NUM variables : NUM measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN graph ( sometimes called a NOUN NOUN ) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN represents a group as a whole . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this NOUN VERB an alternative approach to describing personal NOUN , called indifference curves , which VERB any need for using numbers to measure utility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by setting ADV the assumption of VERB a ADJ NOUN on utility — an assumption that many students and economists find ADV ADJ — the indifference curve framework helps to VERB the NOUN of the underlying model . what is an indifference curve ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from this starting point , her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low , while the marginal utility lost from additional NOUN would be relatively high — so on the NOUN , it will take a relatively smaller number of NOUN to VERB the change of NUM marginal book . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in short , the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of NOUN — that is , the quantity of NUM good that would be VERB for the other good to keep utility constant — also changes , as a result of VERB marginal utility of both goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> anyone who faces a change in price will experience NUM ADJ NOUN : a NOUN effect and an income effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN effect is that when a good becomes more expensive , people seek out NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NOUN become more expensive , fruit - NOUN scale back on NOUN and eat more NOUN , NOUN , or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN effect VERB how PROPN would have changed her hours of work if her wage had VERB , so that income was relatively ADJ to earn and NOUN was relatively more expensive , but if she had remained at the same level of utility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the slope of the budget constraint in a labor - NOUN diagram is determined by the wage rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the VERB line is ADV VERB with the slope of the new opportunity set , VERB the labor - NOUN NOUN of the new wage rate , but ADJ to the original indifference curve , showing the same level of utility or “ buying power . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the shift from original choice a to point c , which is the point of NOUN between the original indifference curve and the ADJ line , shows that because of the higher wage , PROPN will want to consume less NOUN and more income . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the expenditure - output model , sometimes also called the keynesian cross diagram , VERB the equilibrium level of real gdp by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the keynesian cross diagram presented in [ link ] show real gdp on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the NOUN is in equilibrium , it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real gdp — because by definition , gdp is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the equilibrium calculated with a keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal — which will only occur along the ADJ line . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the marginal NOUN to consume ( PROPN ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person VERB to VERB to consumption expenditures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the marginal NOUN to save ( PROPN ) is the share of the additional dollar a person VERB to save . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it must always hold true that : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> imports are drawn in the keynesian cross diagram as a downward - VERB line , with the downward slope determined by the marginal NOUN to VERB ( PROPN ) , out of national income . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] ( b ) , the marginal NOUN to VERB is NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the aggregate expenditure function is formed by VERB on top of each other the consumption function ( after taxes ) , the investment function , the government spending function , the NOUN function , and the NOUN function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the point at which the aggregate expenditure function VERB the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment , government , and NOUN expenditures — which do not vary with national income . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conversely , [ link ] ( b ) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule ( PROPN ) VERB the ADJ line above potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gap between the level of real gdp at the equilibrium NOUN and potential gdp is called an inflationary gap . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the inflationary gap also requires a NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of NUM party without VERB a cost on another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , if a situation is ADJ , it becomes possible to benefit at least NUM party without VERB costs on others . efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning : the economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its ADJ resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those producers who would have been willing to supply the NOUN at $ NUM , but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $ NUM , clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled g — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a very real sense , it is like money VERB away that benefits no one . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] ( a ) , the ADJ loss is the area PROPN + NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when ADJ loss exists , it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher , in this case because the price control is VERB some NOUN and NOUN from transactions they would both be willing to make . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a second change from the price NOUN is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after the price NOUN is imposed , the new consumer surplus is t + v , while the new producer surplus is x . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows a way of VERB the exchange of a ADJ photon between NUM positive charges . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this graph of time versus position is called a PROPN diagram , after the ADJ american NOUN richard PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) who developed it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] is a PROPN diagram for the exchange of a ADJ NOUN between a NOUN and a NOUN representing the same interaction as in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN are not only a useful tool for VERB interactions at the quantum mechanical level , they are also used to calculate NOUN of interactions , such as their NOUN and probability of occurring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are particles that feel the strong nuclear force , whereas NOUN are particles that do not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , NOUN , and the NOUN are examples of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN that can decay to NOUN and leave no NOUN , which implies that NOUN are not VERB in number . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN that always decay to another NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a new physical quantity called NOUN number b b size NUM { b } { } seems to always be VERB in nature and is listed for the various particles in the NOUN given above . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> keep in mind that all NOUN seem to be fundamental , NOUN NOUN are fundamental . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is strong evidence that NOUN are the fundamental building blocks of NOUN as seen in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are the second group of fundamental particles ( NOUN are the first ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a combination of NOUN has color other than white , it VERB extremely large forces — even larger than the strong force — and perhaps can not be stable or ADV separated . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is part of the theory of PROPN NOUN , which VERB how NOUN can exist and yet never be VERB or directly observed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , an extra quantum number with NUM values ( like those we VERB to color ) is necessary for NOUN to VERB the PROPN NOUN principle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of physics VERB the story in making a connection with NOUN , on the opposite end of the distance scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] is a PROPN diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle NOUN NOUN size NUM { z rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } , similar to the NOUN in [ link ] and [ link ] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the 1960s , a NOUN theory , called NOUN theory , was developed by PROPN PROPN , PROPN PROPN , and PROPN PROPN and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at ADV high NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of its NOUN , in addition to describing both electromagnetic and weak force phenomena , was the existence of the PROPN , PROPN PROPN , NOUN , and ADV NOUN carrier particles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , there is enough energy when things are pushed to even smaller NOUN to VERB the , and NOUN NOUN size NUM { z rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } into ADJ carrier particles more similar to NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these have not been observed ADV , but there is a NOUN of an associated particle called the PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mass of this particle is not VERB with nearly the NOUN with which the mass of the PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , NOUN , and ADV NOUN size NUM { z rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } particles were VERB , but it was VERB that the PROPN NOUN could be observed at the now - VERB PROPN PROPN PROPN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps the most important characteristic of the universe is that all NOUN except those in our local NOUN seem to be moving away from us at NOUN proportional to their distance from our NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it looks as if a ADJ NOUN , ADV called the big PROPN , VERB matter out some NOUN of years ago . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ NOUN is based on the ADJ work of PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) , the american NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at NUM PROPN s NUM PROPN s size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { - " NUM " } } ` s } { } , the average energy VERB the ADJ NUM PROPN v NUM PROPN NUM size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { " NUM " } } ` " PROPN v " } { } needed to VERB gravity with the other forces in NOUN , the theory of everything . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before that time is the NOUN NOUN , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no ADJ theory of quantum gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we call the ADJ ADJ force NOUN . now let us imagine starting at NOUN and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we know from special relativity that relativity is the study of how different NOUN measure the same event , particularly if they move relative to NUM another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> einstein ’s theory of general relativity describes all types of relative motion including ADJ motion and the effects of gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> general relativity VERB special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is NUM and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> black NOUN NOUN are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bodies , like the earth or the sun , have what is called an escape velocity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these objects were first discovered in NUM by the british NOUN , PROPN bell and PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN are literally a NOUN composed of neutrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are formed by the NOUN of a NOUN ’s core in a NOUN , during which electrons and protons are forced together to form neutrons ( the reverse of NOUN β β size NUM { β } { } decay ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> introduced earlier in PROPN : the PROPN of forces PROPN theory is an attempt to VERB gravity with the other NUM forces and , thus , must contain quantum gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the main NOUN of PROPN theory is that fundamental particles , including the NOUN that carries the gravitational force , act like NUM - dimensional VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , the most recent measurements of the PROPN have NOUN for the ADJ constant , so it is not simply a device VERB for a single purpose . after the recent experimental discovery of the ADJ constant , most researchers feel that the universe should be just ADV open . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since matter can be thought to curve the space around it , we call an open universe ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means that you can in principle travel an ADJ distance in any direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the question is open as to how many NOUN or other bodies smaller than about NUM the mass of the sun are there . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if such bodies pass between us and a NOUN , they will not block the NOUN ’s light , being too small , but they will form a gravitational lens , as discussed in general relativity and quantum gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a process called NOUN , light from the NOUN is focused and the NOUN appears to VERB in a characteristic manner . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in ADJ NOUN because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most radical proposal to explain dark matter is that it consists of previously ADJ NOUN ( sometimes ADV referred to as non - ADJ matter ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are called ADV VERB massive particles , or NOUN , and would also be NOUN , thus VERB ADV with normal matter , except through NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM proposed group of PROPN would have NOUN several NOUN of magnitude greater than NOUN and are sometimes called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is also based ADV in physics and VERB broad classes of phenomena from many NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a word used to describe systems whose outcomes are extremely sensitive to initial conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the NOUN PROPN , for example , may be ADJ in that it can change ADV due to small interactions with other NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , if you VERB a NOUN past a ADJ NOUN bell , you will hear the bell ’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and NOUN is called a PROPN shift . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN effect and PROPN shift are named for the ADJ NOUN and NOUN christian PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , who did experiments with both moving sources and moving NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> power is associated by many people with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB that power is the rate of energy use or energy NOUN , what is the expression for electric power ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> power transmission lines might come to mind . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN was involved in many early NOUN and in the NOUN of physics programs in american NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he was VERB the NUM PROPN PROPN in physics for the NOUN and nuclear NOUN , and he has an element and NUM major NOUN named for him . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a version of a NOUN in which the frequency of the VERB voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the NOUN particles are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed - NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> its cost as well as the politics of international research funding led to its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to the large NOUN that produce VERB NOUN of protons and NOUN , there are other large electron - NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ of these was a straight - line or linear NOUN , called the PROPN linear PROPN ( PROPN ) , which VERB particles up to NUM PROPN as seen in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN created by the NOUN were brought to the same energy and VERB with electrons in ADV designed NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> generally , you VERB up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when we do this , we are VERB on a number of ADJ cues , or cues that require only NUM eye . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you think you VERB n’t see depth with NUM eye , note that you do n’t VERB into things when using only NUM eye while VERB — and , in fact , we have more ADJ cues than ADJ cues . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the outer ear includes the NOUN , which is the visible part of the ear that VERB from our NOUN , the auditory canal , and the ADJ membrane , or NOUN . the middle ear contains NUM ADJ bones known as the NOUN , which are named the PROPN ( or NOUN ) , PROPN ( or NOUN ) , and the NOUN ( or NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the inner ear contains the semi - circular NOUN , which are involved in balance and movement ( the ADJ sense ) , and the cochlea . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the NOUN VERB into the ADJ NOUN , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the ADJ membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ membrane is a thin NOUN of tissue within the cochlea . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ability to VERB sound in our environments is an important part of hearing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB sound could be considered similar to the way that we VERB depth in our visual fields . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more ADJ at your right ear than at your left ear because of the NOUN of the sound wave as it passes through your head . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave VERB at each ear ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> certain brain areas VERB these differences to VERB where along a horizontal axis a sound VERB ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM disease that results in ADJ hearing loss is PROPN 's disease . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although not well understood , PROPN 's disease results in a NOUN of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , NOUN ( constant NOUN or NOUN ) , PROPN ( a sense of NOUN ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this kind of loss can not be treated with hearing PROPN , but some individuals might be candidates for a ADJ NOUN as a treatment NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taste ( NOUN ) and NOUN ( NOUN ) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a ADJ interaction between our chemical senses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many species respond to chemical NOUN , known as NOUN , sent by another individual ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this very rare genetic disorder is known as ADJ NOUN to pain ( or ADJ NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while those with ADJ NOUN can detect differences in temperature and pressure , they can not experience pain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , and his NOUN PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN , who later became his NOUN , believed that perception involved more than simply VERB sensory stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as PROPN psychology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word NOUN literally means form or pattern , but its use VERB the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we might also use the principle of NOUN to group things in our visual fields . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this principle , things that are ADV tend to be VERB together ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to PROPN theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to VERB among different NOUN and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you probably feel fairly certain that your perception ADV VERB the real world , but this is not always the case . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> built from NOUN , but influenced by our own experiences , NOUN , NOUN , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research suggests that ADJ racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - black participants identify weapons ADV and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the NOUN is VERB with the image of a black person ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> learning , like NOUN and NOUN , allows an organism to VERB to its environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but unlike NOUN and NOUN , learned behaviors involve change and experience : learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves VERB knowledge and skills through experience . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , a ADJ scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as we discussed ADV in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , ADV , to VERB events . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ’s research on the digestive system of dogs ADV led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN in this situation was an ADJ stimulus ( PROPN ) : a stimulus that VERB a ADJ response in an organism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the dogs ’ NOUN was an ADJ response ( PROPN ) : a natural ( ADJ ) reaction to a given stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before conditioning , think of the dogs ’ stimulus and response like this : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eventually , the dogs began to VERB to the tone alone , just as they previously had VERB at the sound of the NOUN ’ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of PROPN ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( PROPN ) with being VERB , and they began to VERB ( PROPN ) in NOUN of food . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taste NOUN is a type of conditioning in which an NOUN of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something VERB ) and the ADJ stimulus ( NOUN or illness ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here ’s how it works . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a ADJ event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond ADV ( such as running away if the sound is VERB ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when an organism VERB to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in classical conditioning terms , the organism VERB the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> john b. PROPN , shown in [ link ] , is considered the NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a school of thought that VERB during the first part of the ADJ century , which VERB elements of PROPN ’s classical conditioning ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are VERB to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by ADJ consequences are less likely to be repeated ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in negative reinforcement , an ADJ stimulus is removed to increase a behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , car NOUN use the principles of negative reinforcement in their NOUN systems , which go “ NOUN , INTJ , NOUN ” until you VERB your NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this case , a stimulus ( the NOUN ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( VERB in class ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in negative punishment , you remove a ADJ stimulus to decrease behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , when a child VERB , a parent can take away a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a secondary NOUN has no ADJ value and only has VERB NOUN when linked with a primary NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , linked to NOUN , is NUM example of a secondary NOUN , as when you called out “ great NOUN PUNCT ” every time PROPN made a goal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now let ’s combine these NUM terms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a fixed NOUN reinforcement schedule is when behavior is VERB after a set amount of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , june VERB major NOUN in a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a variable ratio reinforcement schedule , the number of responses needed for a NOUN varies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as soon as the NOUN became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the NOUN quickly , just as quickly as the NOUN group , which had been VERB with food all along . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as ADJ learning : learning that occurs but is not ADJ in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it . psychologist PROPN PROPN found that NOUN use cognitive maps to VERB through a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> have you ever worked your way through various levels on a NOUN NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is much more obvious in humans , but is NOUN really the ADJ form of NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider PROPN ’s experience with ADJ learning . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , if you observed the model being VERB , you would be less motivated to VERB her . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called ADJ punishment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , imagine that NUM - year - old PROPN VERB her older sister PROPN VERB in their mother ’s makeup , and then saw PROPN get a time out when their mother came in . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cognitive psychology is the field of psychology VERB to VERB how people think . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , NOUN , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in psychology , concepts can be divided into NUM categories , natural and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> natural concepts are created “ naturally ” through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or ADJ experiences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if you live in PROPN PROPN , PROPN , you have probably had a NOUN of direct experience with NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are several types of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a role NOUN makes NOUN about how individuals in certain roles will behave ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , imagine you meet someone who VERB PRON as a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> language , be it VERB , signed , or written , has specific components : a NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN refers to the words of a given language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , NOUN is a language ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN ( e.g. , the sounds “ INTJ ” ADP “ INTJ ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different NOUN have different sets of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are combined to form NOUN , which are the ADJ units of language that VERB some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ i ” is both a NOUN and a NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we use NOUN and NOUN to VERB language . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , young children NOUN language very quickly with relative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> b. f. skinner ( NUM ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) VERB this NOUN approach , VERB instead that the mechanisms underlying language NOUN are ADV determined . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a problem - solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is another type of problem solving strategy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while an NOUN must be followed exactly to produce a correct result , a NOUN is a general problem - solving framework ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you can think of these as mental NOUN that are used to VERB problems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> functional NOUN is a type of mental set where you can not VERB an object being used for something other than what it was designed for . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the PROPN NUM NOUN to the NOUN , PROPN NOUN at PROPN control had to VERB functional NOUN to save the lives of the NOUN ADP the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , if you think that your NOUN is not very ADJ , you VERB all of the instances of ADJ behavior VERB by the NOUN while VERB the ADJ ADJ interactions he is involved in on a daily basis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , you VERB all along that things would turn out the way they did . <sent_end> <sent_begin> representative bias describes a ADJ way of thinking , in which you ADV VERB someone or something ; for example , you may VERB that your NOUN spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual NOUN , because the idea of them spending their time VERB NOUN or VERB an NOUN NOUN does not fit in with your stereotypes of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> james VERB that behavior was driven by a number of NOUN , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from a biological perspective , an NOUN is a species - specific pattern of behavior that is not learned . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there was , however , considerable NOUN among james and his NOUN over the ADJ definition of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> researchers robert PROPN ( VERB “ PROPN - PROPN ” ) and john PROPN discovered that the ADJ arousal level depends on the NOUN and difficulty of the task to be performed ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this relationship is known as PROPN - PROPN law , which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s PROPN of PROPN the theories of NOUN described earlier relate to basic biological NOUN , individual characteristics , or social NOUN , abraham PROPN ( NUM ) proposed a NOUN of needs that VERB the spectrum of NOUN VERB from the biological to the individual to the social . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these needs are often VERB as a NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ intelligence is marked by VERB or VERB a solution to a problem or situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN in this realm can include finding a ADJ solution to an ADJ problem or producing a ADJ work of art or a well - developed short story . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the NOUN ; ” it allows an individual to VERB at unique , multiple NOUN to a given problem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , ADJ thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well - established answer or solution to a problem ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the various NOUN and NOUN signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are VERB in the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and PROPN are especially important sites where this integration occurs ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> when someone VERB more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height , they are considered ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the centers for disease control and PROPN ( PROPN ) , an adult with a body mass index ( PROPN ) between NUM and NUM is considered ADJ ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an adult with a PROPN of NUM or higher is considered ADJ ( centers for disease control and PROPN [ PROPN ] , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of NOUN , ADJ NOUN may be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is a type of NOUN specifically VERB at weight reduction , and it involves VERB the ADJ system to reduce the amount of food that can be VERB and/or limiting how much of the ADJ food can be absorbed ( [ link ] ) ( PROPN PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a recent ADJ - analysis suggests that ADJ NOUN is more effective than non - ADJ treatment for NOUN in the NUM - years immediately following the NOUN , but to date , no long - term studies yet exist ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as of the NUM release of the diagnostic and statistical PROPN , fifth NOUN , NOUN eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the american PROPN association ( apa ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike with NOUN , eating NOUN are not followed by ADJ behavior , such as NOUN , but they are followed by distress , including feelings of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN were considered NOUN on all issues related to sex , despite the fact that they had little to no NOUN in these issues , and it is likely that most of what people VERB about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by VERB with their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB that people would benefit from a more open NOUN on issues related to human NOUN , PROPN PROPN PROPN of PROPN university VERB large - scale survey research on the topic ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the results of some of these efforts were published in NUM books — sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female — which were published in NUM and NUM , respectively ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> based on these observations , PROPN and johnson divided the sexual response cycle into NUM phases that are fairly similar in men and women : NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and resolution ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by NOUN of the NOUN or NOUN and NOUN and expansion of the ADJ canal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is marked in women by ADJ NOUN of the NOUN and NOUN along with increased muscle tension . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in men , ADJ NOUN are VERB by a NOUN of ADJ fluid near the NOUN that is ultimately forced out by NOUN of ADJ muscles , ( i.e. , NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in reality , these are NUM related , but different , issues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gender identity refers to one ’s sense of being male or female . <sent_end> <sent_begin> generally , our gender NOUN correspond to our ADJ and ADJ sex , but this is not always the case . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while you VERB likely familiar with the term “ PROPN ” and associate it with the idea of intelligence , what does PROPN really mean ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB for intelligence NOUN and describes a NOUN earned on a test designed to measure intelligence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you VERB already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence ( or more ADV , NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the ADJ NOUN have led to an interesting observation known as the PROPN effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> named after james PROPN , who was among the first to describe this NOUN , the PROPN effect refers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher NOUN than the last . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PRON VERB , however , that increased PROPN NOUN do not necessarily mean that ADJ NOUN are more ADJ per X ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person ’s parents . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists who research this topic typically use ADJ studies to determine the NOUN of intelligence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN study of PROPN VERB apart is NUM of the most well - known ADJ studies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> children with PROPN have a learning NOUN that results in a NOUN to write ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the physical task of writing with a NOUN and paper is extremely challenging for the person . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> emotions are often thought to be ADV experienced and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mood , on the other hand , refers to a ADJ , less ADJ , ADJ state that does not occur in response to something we experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mood states may not be ADV recognized and do not carry the NOUN that is associated with emotion ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other theorists , however , VERB that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the PROPN - PROPN theory of emotion was developed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this view , physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously , yet ADV ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the relationship between our NOUN of emotions and our cognitive processing of them , and the order in which these occur , remains a topic of research and debate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) developed the cognitive - ADJ theory that VERB our emotions are determined by our NOUN of the stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN VERB between the stimulus and the emotional response , and it is immediate and often unconscious . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is composed of various NOUN , including the ADJ complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ complex has ADJ connections with a variety of sensory areas of the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is critical for classical conditioning and for VERB emotional value to learning processes and memory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> culture can impact the way in which people display emotion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a cultural display rule is NUM of a collection of ADV specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of NOUN of emotions that are acceptable ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , people from varying cultural NOUN can have very different cultural display rules of emotion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we also use the tone of our NOUN , various behaviors , and body language to communicate information about our emotional states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> body language is the expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information VERB through body language , even if we VERB not ADV aware of it ( de PROPN , NUM ; PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the centuries after PROPN , other researchers VERB to the development of his NUM primary NOUN types , most ADV PROPN PROPN ( in the ADJ century ) and psychologist PROPN PROPN ( in the ADJ century ) ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM / NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN agreed with PROPN that everyone could be VERB into NUM of the NUM NOUN and that there was no NOUN between the NUM categories ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> levels of consciousness <sent_end> <sent_begin> to explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience , freud compared the mind to an NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he said that only about NUM - NOUN of our mind is conscious , and the rest of our mind is unconscious . <sent_end> <sent_begin> our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are ADJ and are unable to access ( freud , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it VERB for NOUN and NOUN our behavior , leading to feelings of NOUN or — when we fall short of the ideal — feelings of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast to the ADJ i d and the rule - based NOUN , the NOUN is the rational part of our personality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it ’s what freud considered to be the self , and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eventually you VERB about it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , in the human NOUN , if a memory is too ADJ to deal with , it might be VERB and thus removed from conscious awareness ( freud , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ memory might cause symptoms in other areas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , a NUM - year - old child who VERB the NOUN of a ADJ NOUN may act like a NOUN and VERB to VERB out of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , a person VERB to VERB her own unconscious feelings and instead VERB those feelings in someone else . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other defense mechanisms include NOUN , displacement , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the ADJ stage ( birth to NUM year ) , NOUN is focused on the mouth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> eating and the NOUN derived from VERB ( NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ) play a large part in a NOUN ’s first year of life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> following the ADJ stage of ADJ development is a period known as the NOUN period ( NUM years to NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this period is not considered a stage , because sexual feelings are ADJ as children focus on other NOUN , such as school , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , a NOUN of freud ’s and the first president of the PROPN PROPN society ( freud ’s inner NOUN of NOUN ) , was the first major NOUN to break away from freud ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he ADV founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to VERB for feelings of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM , NUM ) proposed the concept of the NOUN complex . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) was a ADJ NOUN and NOUN of freud , who later split off from freud and developed his own theory , which he called ADJ psychology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the focus of ADJ psychology is on working to balance VERB forces of conscious and unconscious thought , and experience within one ’s personality . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN was NUM of the first women VERB as a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the great depression , PROPN moved from germany to the united states , and ADV moved away from freud ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if someone VERB you what you VERB for NOUN today , more than likely you could recall this information quite easily . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as automatic processing , or the NOUN of NOUN like time , space , frequency , and the meaning of words . <sent_end> <sent_begin> automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> visual NOUN is the NOUN of images , and ADJ NOUN is the NOUN of sounds , words in particular . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to see how visual NOUN works , read over this list of words : car , level , NOUN , NOUN , book , value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> storage is the creation of a permanent record of information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through NUM distinct stages : sensory memory , short - term memory , and finally long - term memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these stages were first proposed by richard PROPN and richard PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM study of sensory memory VERB the NOUN of ADJ information on short - term memory storage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s : you will name a color more easily if it appears VERB in that color , which is called the PROPN effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , the word “ red ” will be named more quickly , regardless of the color the word appears in , than any word that is colored red . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> long - term memory ( PROPN ) is the continuous storage of information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike short - term memory , the storage capacity of PROPN has no limits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ memory is a type of ADJ memory : it stores information about how to do things . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is the memory for skilled actions , such as how to VERB your teeth , how to drive a car , how to VERB the NOUN ( NOUN ) NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ memory is information about events we have ADV experienced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the concept of ADJ memory was first proposed about NUM years ago ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how do you get that information back out of storage when you need it ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously VERB on your computer ’s hard drive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the third form of NOUN is VERB , and it ’s just what it sounds like . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it involves learning information that you previously learned . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , let ’s look at the role of the NOUN in memory formation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the main job of the NOUN is to regulate emotions , such as fear and aggression ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory , such as NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although we do n’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory , we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other words , people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> b. f. skinner , a strict NOUN , believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior , including the ADJ , consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast to skinner ’s idea that the environment alone VERB behavior , PROPN ( NUM ) proposed the concept of ADJ NOUN , in which cognitive processes , behavior , and context all interact , each factor VERB and being influenced by the others simultaneously ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cognitive processes refer to all characteristics previously learned , including beliefs , expectations , and personality characteristics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) proposed the concept of NOUN of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> distinct from self - NOUN , which involves our belief in our own NOUN , NOUN of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN ’s view , people possess either an internal or an external NOUN of control ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is commonly caused by brain NOUN , such as a NOUN to the head . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with ADJ NOUN , you can not remember new information , although you can remember information and events that VERB prior to your NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is usually affected ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because memory is so ADJ , NOUN can be easily ( and often ADV ) VERB due to the problem of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN describes the effects of NOUN from external sources that leads to the creation of false memories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the fall of NUM , a NOUN in the dc area VERB people at a gas NOUN , leaving home PROPN , and VERB down the street . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> she has studied false memories as well as VERB memories of childhood sexual abuse . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN also developed the NOUN effect NOUN , which holds that after exposure to ADJ information , a person may VERB the original event . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let ’s look at the first NOUN of the VERB NOUN : NOUN , which means that memories can VERB over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here ’s an example of how this happens . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now let ’s take a look at the NUM NOUN of NOUN : NOUN , NOUN , and bias . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN happens when you VERB the source of your information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let ’s say PROPN was VERB PROPN and they saw the first PROPN NOUN together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the new year VERB , do you find you ADV write the previous year ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are examples of ADJ interference : when old information VERB the recall of newly learned information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ interference happens when information learned more recently VERB the recall of older information . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this perspective focuses on how healthy people develop . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM VERB NOUN , abraham PROPN , studied people who he considered to be healthy , ADJ , and productive , including PROPN einstein , PROPN roosevelt , thomas jefferson , abraham lincoln , and others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM , NUM ) found that such people share similar characteristics , such as being open , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , concerned for others , and VERB of themselves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve NOUN between these NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we experience NOUN when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar — in other words , when our self - concept is accurate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high NOUN leads to a greater sense of self - worth and a healthy , productive life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> soil particles between NUM and NUM NOUN are called NOUN , and even smaller particles , less than NUM NOUN in diameter , are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ; these soils are called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN soils form directly from the NOUN of NOUN , the solid rock that VERB ADP the soil , and therefore , they have a similar NOUN to the original rock . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the soil NOUN has NUM distinct layers : 1 ) NOUN NOUN ; 2 ) a NOUN ; 3 ) b NOUN , or NOUN ; and 4 ) c NOUN , or soil base ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN has ADV VERB organic matter — NOUN — at its surface , with VERB NOUN at its base . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB the soil with nutrients and VERB soil NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ plant depends on its host for survival . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some ADJ plants have no leaves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN is a plant that VERB on other plants , but is not dependent upon the other plant for NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have NUM types of roots : VERB ADJ roots , which absorb nutrients from NOUN that VERB in the NOUN of trees ; and ADJ roots , which absorb NOUN from the atmosphere . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after reaching NOUN , the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis , which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN has NOUN with NOUN that contain the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ group of structures in the flower is the NOUN , or the female reproductive component ( s ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is the individual unit of the NOUN and has a NOUN , style , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> female gametophyte ( the embryo sac ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the NOUN may vary between species , the overall development of the female gametophyte has NUM distinct phases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , in the process of PROPN , a single cell in the diploid NOUN — an area of tissue in the NOUN — VERB meiosis to produce NUM NOUN , only NUM of which VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the second phase , PROPN , the VERB haploid PROPN VERB mitosis to produce an NUM - ADJ , NUM - cell female gametophyte , also known as the PROPN or embryo sac . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this central cell later VERB with a sperm to form the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the NOUN and develop into the ADJ cells , which later VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nucleus ADJ to the NOUN becomes the female NOUN , or egg cell , and the NUM adjacent nuclei develop into ADJ cells ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> male PROPN male NOUN has a central axis on which NOUN , a type of modified leaf , are attached . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are known as PROPN ( [ link ] ) and are the sites where NOUN will develop . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN develop inside the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> pollination takes NUM forms : self - pollination and cross - pollination . <sent_end> <sent_begin> self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the NOUN is VERB on the NOUN of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the NOUN of NUM flower to the NOUN of another flower on a different individual of the same species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the pollen tube is VERB by the chemicals secreted by the NOUN present in the embryo sac , and it enters the NOUN sac through the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> of the NUM sperm cells , NUM sperm VERB the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm NOUN with the NUM polar nuclei , forming a ADJ cell that develops into the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , these NUM fertilization events in NOUN are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ cell also VERB , giving rise to a ADJ - shaped ADJ ( [ link ] a ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN ( NOUN ) , the developing embryo has a heart shape , due to the presence of the NUM ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] b ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in non - ADJ NOUN , such as PROPN NOUN , the NOUN develops initially , but is then VERB , and the food reserves are moved into the NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM NOUN in the ADJ seed also have vascular connections to the embryo . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ NOUN , the food reserves are stored in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during NOUN , the NUM NOUN therefore act as ADJ organs to take up the ADV released food reserves , much like in NOUN ( NOUN , by definition , also have ADJ seeds ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the embryonic axis consists of NUM parts : the PROPN , the NOUN , and the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the portion of the embryo between the NOUN attachment point and the NOUN is known as the PROPN ( PROPN means “ below the NOUN ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the embryonic axis VERB in a NOUN ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the ADJ system is a connected set of structures that VERB emotion , as well as behaviors related to fear and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> schizophrenia is a ADJ and often VERB mental illness VERB NUM percent of people in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> symptoms of the disease include the inability to VERB between reality and NOUN , ADJ and ADJ emotional responses , difficulty thinking , and problems with social situations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> additionally , we possess general senses , also called NOUN , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , which is an organism ’s sense of ADJ orientation and balance , NOUN ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of NOUN position that is used to VERB PROPN ( NOUN movement ) are part of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first step in NOUN is NOUN , which is the NOUN of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli ( being ADJ or VERB , for example ) , chemicals , or temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the receptor can then respond to the stimuli . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this example , a type of receptor called a NOUN ( as shown in [ link ] ) VERB specialized membranes that respond to pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> disturbance of these NOUN by VERB them or VERB them VERB ADJ ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> note that these NOUN NOUN are VERB ADJ in the skin than are the cold NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is not ADJ , then , that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect ADJ stimuli . ADJ NOUN ( seen in [ link ] ) are located deep in the NOUN of both ADJ and ADJ skin and are ADV similar to PROPN ’s NOUN ; they are found in the bone NOUN , joint NOUN , pancreas and other NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are rapidly VERB NOUN that sense deep ADJ ( but not ADJ ) pressure and high - frequency NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> pain is the name given to NOUN , which is the ADJ processing of ADJ stimuli in response to tissue damage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> pain is caused by true sources of NOUN , such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal NOUN or contact with a ADJ chemical . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , ADJ part of the ear called the NOUN , then travel through the auditory canal and cause NOUN of the thin NOUN called the NOUN or ear NOUN , the ADJ part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> interior to the NOUN is the middle ear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the middle ear holds NUM small bones called the NOUN , which transfer energy from the moving NOUN to the inner ear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM NOUN are the PROPN ( also known as the NOUN ) , the PROPN ( the NOUN ) , and PROPN ( the NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADV named PROPN looks very much like a NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the site of transduction is in the organ of PROPN ( ADJ organ ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is composed of hair cells held in place above the ADJ membrane like flowers VERB up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like NOUN VERB or embedded in the ADJ membrane above them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and VERB them into images . <sent_end> <sent_begin> animals are VERB with sensory information , and the ADJ volume of visual information can be ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it passes through other layers that process it so that it can be VERB by the retina ( [ link ] b ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , the front ADJ layer of the eye , and the ADJ lens , a ADJ ADJ structure behind the NOUN , both VERB ( VERB ) light to focus the image on the retina . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , which is ADJ as the colored part of the eye , is a circular ADJ ring VERB between the lens and NOUN that VERB the amount of light entering the eye . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN occurs because the image focuses behind the retina . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a deficit similar to a different type of NOUN called NOUN caused by an NOUN that is too short . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for both NOUN , images in the distance are clear but images ADV are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for ADJ vision . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN has a high density of cones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the ADJ NOUN in the NOUN , where eye movements are VERB and VERB with auditory information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the NOUN nucleus ( PROPN ) of the hypothalamus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taste , also called NOUN , and NOUN , also called NOUN , are the most ADJ senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and NOUN to receptors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential NOUN , NOUN , or VERB — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN ( NOUN molecules ) enter the NOUN and VERB in the olfactory NOUN , the NOUN at the back of the NOUN cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the olfactory NOUN is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the NOUN cavity that VERB an area about NUM NOUN in humans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that sensory cells are neurons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or NOUN of animals of the same species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ signals can have ADJ effects on animals that VERB them , but NOUN ADV are not ADV perceived in the same way as other NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> olfactory neurons project from the olfactory NOUN to the olfactory NOUN as thin , ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the olfactory NOUN is composed of ADJ NOUN called NOUN , and each NOUN receives signals from NUM type of olfactory receptor , so each NOUN is specific to NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from NOUN , olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the amino acid - derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids NOUN and NOUN , shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a hormone is amino acid - derived , its chemical name will end in “ NUM ” . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> additionally , the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time , resulting in increased or VERB cell NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not NOUN - derived ( NOUN - ADJ ) and therefore can not VERB through the plasma membrane of cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ ADJ hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane , via plasma membrane hormone receptors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike ADJ hormones , ADJ ADJ hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on dna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a hormone binds to the receptor , the g - protein is activated by binding NOUN NOUN , or gtp , in place of gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after binding , gtp is VERB by the g - protein into gdp and becomes ADJ . the activated g - protein in turn VERB a membrane - bound enzyme called NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN VERB the NOUN of atp to camp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the anterior pituitary gland , or PROPN , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the NOUN , and to the anterior pituitary . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this capillary network is a part of the ADJ PROPN system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN system carries blood from NUM capillary network to another ; therefore , the ADJ PROPN system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system . the anterior pituitary produces NUM hormones : growth hormone ( PROPN ) , NOUN ( NOUN ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( PROPN ) , NOUN - stimulating hormone ( PROPN ) , PROPN hormone ( PROPN ) , NOUN - stimulating hormone ( PROPN ) , and ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the thyroid gland is located in the NOUN , just below the NOUN and in front of the NOUN , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a NOUN - shaped gland with NUM NOUN that are connected by the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most people have NUM ADJ glands ; however , the number can vary from NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> schizophrenia is a ADJ psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought , perception , emotion , and behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> about NUM % of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime , and usually the disorder is first VERB during early NOUN ( early to NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ thinking refers to ADJ and ADJ thought processes — usually VERB by what a person says . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the person might VERB , exhibit ADJ NOUN ( VERB from topic to topic ) , or VERB in a way that is so ADJ and ADJ that it seems as though the person is ADV VERB words . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> negative symptoms are those that reflect ADJ decreases and NOUN in certain behaviors , emotions , or NOUN ( green , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person who VERB ADJ emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial NOUN , speech , or movements , even when such NOUN are normal or expected . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although a number of NOUN have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia ( PROPN , NUM ) , such NOUN can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia , or vice ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these experiences can include such events as combat , ADJ or actual physical attack , sexual NOUN , natural NOUN , ADJ attacks , and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN makes NOUN the only disorder listed in the PROPN in which a cause ( extreme NOUN ) is ADV VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> symptoms of PROPN include ADJ and ADJ memories of the event , NOUN ( states that can last from a few NOUN to several days , during which the individual VERB the event and VERB as if the event were occurring at that moment [ apa , NUM ] ) , NOUN of stimuli connected to the event , ADV negative emotional states ( e.g. , fear , anger , NOUN , and NOUN ) , feelings of NOUN from others , NOUN , NOUN toward NOUN , and an ADJ NOUN response ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for PROPN to be VERB , these symptoms must occur for at least NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ and related disorders are a group of disorders in which NOUN is the VERB feature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a state of extreme NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> people with ADJ ADJ disorder ( previously known as NOUN ) experience VERB NOUN most of the day nearly every day for at least NUM years , as well as at least NUM of the other symptoms of major ADJ disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with ADJ ADJ disorder are ADV ADJ and ADJ , but do not meet all the NOUN for major depression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during a ADJ NOUN , some experience a mood that is almost ADJ and become ADV ADJ , sometimes ADV starting NOUN with NOUN ; others become ADV ADJ and VERB or make hostile NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the person may VERB ADV and rapidly , VERB flight of ideas , ADV VERB from NUM topic to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these individuals are easily VERB , which can make a NOUN very difficult . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another cognitive theory of depression , NOUN theory , VERB that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of NOUN , which then leads to depression ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this theory , NOUN is an NOUN that ADJ outcomes will occur or that VERB outcomes will not occur , and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM possible VERB factor in NOUN is brain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ ADJ research shows that disturbances in the functioning of NOUN are linked to ADJ behavior ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> low levels of NOUN predict future NOUN attempts and NOUN NOUN , and low levels have been observed post - NOUN among NOUN NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although NOUN was traditionally considered to be a NOUN of NOUN , considerable evidence suggests that NOUN represents an entirely different disorder ( PROPN - PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with NOUN disorder can not bear to part with personal NOUN , regardless of how ADJ or ADJ these NOUN are . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , these individuals VERB excessive amounts of usually ADJ items that VERB their living areas ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this woman likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and NOUN than would a ADJ - old college NOUN who is having NOUN finding a date for the annual social . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some people , however , experience anxiety that is excessive , ADJ , and greatly out of NOUN to the actual threat ; if one ’s anxiety has a ADJ influence on NUM ’s life , this is a strong NOUN that the individual is VERB an anxiety disorder . anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and ADJ fear and anxiety , and by related disturbances in behavior ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although anxiety is ADV experienced , anxiety disorders cause considerable distress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) proposed that NOUN can be acquired through NUM major learning NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first pathway is through classical conditioning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you may recall , classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is VERB with an ADJ stimulus ( PROPN ) that ADV VERB an ADJ response ( PROPN ) , VERB the same response through its association with the ADJ stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that VERB anxiety , they typically perform safety behaviors : mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> safety behaviors include VERB eye contact , VERB NOUN before speaking , VERB only ADV , and not VERB about PRON ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ genes and gene functions involved in this disorder , however , are not well - understood ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the NOUN NOUN may play a role in this disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> located in the NOUN , the NOUN NOUN is the brain ’s major source of NOUN , a neurotransmitter that triggers the body ’s fight - or - flight response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , an individual may VERB about her health and NOUN , the health of family members , the safety of her children , or minor matters ( e.g. , being late for an NOUN ) without having any ADJ reason for doing so ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN of ADJ anxiety disorder requires that the NOUN NOUN and NOUN characteristic of this disorder — what PROPN freud referred to as free - VERB anxiety — is not part of another disorder , occurs more days than not for at least NUM months , and is VERB by any NUM of the following symptoms : NOUN , difficulty VERB , being easily ADJ , muscle tension , NOUN , and sleep NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological disorders have a genetic component ; in fact , there is little NOUN that some disorders are largely due to genetic factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the graph in [ link ] shows NOUN NOUN for schizophrenia . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a psychological disorder is a condition characterized by ADJ thoughts , feelings , and behaviors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , NOUN ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term NOUN can also refer to the NOUN of a psychological disorder . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> no universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , NUM of the more ADJ NOUN was proposed by PROPN ( NUM ) , who defined psychological disorder as a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN argued that natural internal mechanisms — that is , psychological processes VERB by evolution , such as NOUN , perception , and learning — have important functions , such as VERB us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought , problem solving , and communication . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the diagnostic and statistical PROPN of mental disorders ( PROPN ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> although a number of NOUN systems have been developed over time , the one that is used by most mental health NOUN in the united states is the diagnostic and statistical PROPN of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) , published by the american PROPN association ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( note that the american PROPN association VERB from the american psychological association ; both are VERB apa . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits , or characteristic ways of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> do you tend to be ADJ or ADJ ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you have learned in this chapter , personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the culture in which you live is NUM of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and NOUN of a particular society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the most widely used personality NOUN is the PROPN PROPN personality NOUN ( PROPN ) , first published in NUM , with NUM true / false questions , and VERB to the NOUN in NUM , with NUM questions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the original PROPN was based on a small , limited sample , composed mostly of PROPN farmers and ADJ patients ; the VERB NOUN was based on a more representative , national sample to allow for better NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second ADJ test is the PROPN PROPN test ( NOUN ) , created in the 1930s by henry PROPN , an american psychologist , and a NOUN named PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person taking the NOUN is shown PROPN ADJ NOUN and is VERB to VERB a story about each picture . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the c - PROPN contains NUM color images that show NOUN of african - american NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the c - PROPN was compared with the NOUN for african americans , it was found that use of the c - PROPN led to increased story length , higher NOUN of positive feelings , and stronger NOUN with the c - PROPN ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN - PROPN & PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN test is another tool designed to be ADV ADJ to minority groups , especially ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN — standing for “ VERB PRON a story ” but also a play on the spanish word NOUN ( NOUN ) — uses images and NOUN cues that relate to minority culture ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each type of NOUN can be identified by the specific pattern of NOUN it VERB from visible light , which is the NOUN spectrum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the graph in [ link ] shows the NOUN NOUN for chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , and a type of ADJ NOUN called β - NOUN ( which VERB blue and green light ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both NOUN have the same basic structure ; a number of NOUN proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound VERB the reaction center where the NOUN takes place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN is VERB by the light - VERB complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple NOUN proteins that contain a mixture of NUM – NUM chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other NOUN like NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those NUM NOUN can undergo NOUN upon NOUN ; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because the electrons have lost energy prior to their NOUN at NOUN , they must be re - VERB by NOUN , hence , another photon is absorbed by the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that energy is VERB to the PROPN reaction center ( called PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is VERB and VERB a high - energy electron to PROPN to form PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM molecules of both atp and PROPN are used . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the NOUN : PROPN means " between " ( for example , VERB lines are those that cross each other ) and NOUN means " inside " ( like NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually ADJ or ADJ molecules called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , VERB a signal in the process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can thus be thought of as signaling molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ signal is a chemical signal that VERB between nerve cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> signals within the nerve cells are VERB by ADV - moving electrical NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> signals from ADJ cells are called endocrine signals , and they VERB from endocrine cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( in the body , many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands , such as the thyroid gland , the hypothalamus , and the pituitary gland . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> internal receptors , also known as intracellular or ADJ receptors , are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to ADJ ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once inside the cell , many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as NOUN of mrna synthesis ( transcription ) to VERB gene expression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ion NOUN - linked receptors bind a ligand and open a NOUN through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to form a NOUN , this type of cell - surface receptor has an extensive membrane - VERB region . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once a ligand binds to a receptor , the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> signal transduction only occurs with cell - surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with dna in the nucleus to VERB protein synthesis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the ligand binds to the cell - surface receptor , the NOUN of the receptor ’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a signaling pathway , second NOUN , enzymes , and activated proteins interact with specific proteins , which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell ’s environment ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second NOUN are small molecules that VERB a signal after it has been VERB by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by VERB the behavior of certain cellular proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> present in small NOUN in the plasma membrane , NOUN NOUN are lipids that can also be converted into second NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because these molecules are membrane components , they are located near membrane - bound receptors and can easily interact with them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN that promote cell growth are called growth factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most growth factors bind to cell - surface receptors that are linked to NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , NOUN are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by NOUN in a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ PROPN ( camp ) is VERB into PROPN by NOUN , and the release of calcium stores is VERB by the NOUN + NOUN that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN uses NOUN as signaling molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the secreted NOUN can be small , ADJ molecules such as ADJ - ADJ NOUN , ( PROPN ) or larger NOUN - based molecules ; each type of molecule has a different NOUN of action . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each species of NOUN has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> human body cells have NUM chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have NUM chromosomes each . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a typical body cell , or ADJ cell , contains NUM VERB sets of chromosomes , a NOUN known as diploid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes . homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide NOUN called genes in exactly the same location , or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the dna - NOUN complex is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , NOUN dna complex is called a NOUN , and dna VERB the NOUN is called NOUN dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a dna molecule in this form is about NUM times shorter than the double helix without the NOUN , and the NOUN are about NUM NOUN in diameter , in contrast with the NUM diameter of a dna double helix . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cell cycle is an VERB series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces NUM new daughter cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells on the path to cell division VERB through a series of ADV VERB and ADV regulated stages of growth , dna replication , and division that produces NUM identical ( NOUN ) cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first stage of NOUN is called the PROPN phase ( first gap ) because , from a ADJ aspect , little change is visible . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , during the PROPN stage , the cell is quite active at the ADJ level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM NOUN will give rise to the ADJ NOUN , the NOUN that VERB the movement of chromosomes during mitosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the center of each animal cell , the NOUN of animal cells are associated with a pair of NOUN - like objects , the NOUN , which are at right NOUN to each other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN help organize cell division . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , also known as mitosis , is divided into a series of phases — NOUN , PROPN , NOUN , VERB , and NOUN — that result in the division of the cell nucleus ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is also called mitosis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during PROPN , the “ first change phase , ” many processes that were begun in NOUN continue to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the nuclear NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during ADV , the “ upward phase , ” the PROPN proteins VERB , and the sister chromatids separate at the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN , now called a chromosome , is VERB rapidly toward the NOUN to which its NOUN is attached . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN VERB the NOUN of the cell ADV , forming a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN , or “ VERB , ” is called the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB as the NOUN ring NOUN , and eventually the membrane is VERB in NUM ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in plant cells , a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cells in NOUN phase are not actively VERB to divide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell is in a ADJ ( ADJ ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some cells enter NOUN ADV until an external signal triggers the NOUN of PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN PROPN PROPN NOUN - NOUN , many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN genes are NOUN of dna that code for negative NOUN proteins , the type of NOUN that , when activated , can prevent the cell from VERB ADJ division . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the collective function of the best - understood NOUN NOUN gene proteins , PROPN , NOUN , and NOUN , is to put up a NOUN to cell cycle NOUN until certain events are completed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the best understood negative regulatory molecules are NOUN protein ( PROPN ) , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN proteins are a group of NOUN - NOUN proteins common in many cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the chromosomes have VERB the NOUN of the ADJ cell , ADJ separation begins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the formation of a ring composed of VERB units of a protein called PROPN VERB the NOUN between the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> formation of the PROPN ring triggers the NOUN of other proteins that work together to VERB new membrane and cell wall materials to the site . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most animals and plants are diploid , containing NUM sets of chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in each ADJ cell of the organism ( all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells ) , the nucleus contains NUM NOUN of each chromosome , called homologous chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ cells are sometimes referred to as “ body ” cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because the events that occur during each of the division stages are ADJ to the events of mitosis , the same stage names are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , because there are NUM NOUN of division , the major process and the stages are VERB with a “ i ” or a “ ii . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , meiosis i is the first round of ADJ division and consists of NOUN i , PROPN i , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> meiosis ii , in which the second round of ADJ division takes place , includes PROPN ii , PROPN ii , and so on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in mitosis , homologous chromosomes line up end - to - end so that when they divide , each daughter cell receives a sister NOUN from both members of the homologous pair . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN complex , a NOUN of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific NOUN and then VERB to cover the entire length of the chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN of the homologous chromosomes is called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> located at NOUN along the NOUN complex are large protein NOUN called recombination NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN VERB the points of later PROPN and VERB the ADJ process of NOUN — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some species , cells enter a brief NOUN , or NOUN , before entering meiosis ii . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB an s phase , so chromosomes are not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fertilization , the NOUN of NUM haploid gametes , VERB the diploid condition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms : diploid - dominant , in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with most animals including humans ; haploid - dominant , in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with all fungi and some algae ; and NOUN of NOUN , in which the NUM stages are ADJ to different NOUN depending on the group , as with plants and some algae . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the zygote will undergo many NOUN of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte . <sent_end> <sent_begin> specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> offspring appear to be a “ NOUN ” of their parents ’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the VERB theory of inheritance VERB that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the NOUN in the offspring , but we now know that this is not the case . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel was the first researcher to see it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plants used in first - generation NOUN were called NOUN , or parental generation NUM , plants ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel collected the seeds VERB to the NOUN plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in his NUM NOUN , mendel reported the results of his NOUN involving NUM different characteristics , each with NUM VERB traits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a ADJ characteristic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the characteristics included plant height , seed NOUN , seed color , flower color , PROPN PROPN size , NOUN PROPN color , and flower position . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dominant traits are those that are inherited ADJ in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recessive traits become ADJ , or VERB , in the offspring of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the recessive trait does , however , ADV in the NOUN of the ADJ offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic , a diploid organism has NUM genetic NOUN that may or may not VERB the same version of that characteristic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gene NOUN that arise by NOUN and exist at the same relative NOUN on homologous chromosomes are called alleles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel VERB the inheritance of genes with just NUM allele forms , but it is common to VERB more than NUM alleles for any given gene in a natural population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN plants that mendel used in his experiments were each ADJ for the trait he was studying . <sent_end> <sent_begin> diploid organisms that are ADJ at a given gene , or NOUN , have NUM identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel ’s parental NOUN plants always VERB true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the dominant seed color is yellow ; therefore , the parental NOUN were PROPN for the plants with yellow seeds and PROPN for the plants with green seeds , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a PROPN NOUN , VERB by the british NOUN PROPN PROPN , can be drawn that VERB the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB a PROPN NOUN , all possible NOUN of the parental alleles are listed along the top ( for NUM parent ) and side ( for the other parent ) of a NOUN , representing their ADJ segregation into haploid gametes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( note that different ADJ NOUN are used for ADJ NOUN to distinguish these patterns from simple NOUN and NOUN . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern of inheritance is described as ADJ NOUN , VERB the expression of NUM VERB alleles such that the individual VERB an intermediate phenotype . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the allele for red flowers is ADV dominant over the allele for white flowers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to VERB the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often VERB “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all other NOUN or NOUN are considered NOUN of this standard , meaning that they VERB from the wild type . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN may be recessive or dominant to the wild - type allele . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because of the location of the eye - color gene , ADJ NOUN do not produce the same offspring NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> males are said to be PROPN , because they have only NUM allele for any x - linked characteristic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN makes the NOUN of NOUN and NOUN ADJ for PROPN males . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel ’s law of NOUN states that in a NOUN , NUM trait will VERB the presence of another trait for the same characteristic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rather than both alleles VERB to a phenotype , the dominant allele will be expressed ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel ’s law of independent ADJ states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the NOUN of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the independent NOUN of genes can be illustrated by the PROPN cross , a cross between NUM true - VERB parents that express different traits for NUM characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider the characteristics of seed color and seed NOUN for NUM NOUN plants , one that has green , ADJ seeds ( PROPN ) and another that has yellow , round seeds ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that same year , PROPN PROPN observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , these observations led to the development of the PROPN theory of inheritance , which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for ADJ inheritance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because they correspond to new allele NOUN , the NOUN PROPN and PROPN are ADJ types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> parental types are ADJ that exhibit the same ADJ combination as their parents . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and his NOUN , however , found that when such ADJ individuals were test VERB to a ADJ recessive parent ( PROPN NOUN PROPN ) , both parental and ADJ cases occurred . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN and ADJ observation of chromosomes forms the basis of NOUN and is the primary method by which NOUN detect ADJ NOUN in humans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , NOUN pattern , and NOUN position . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to obtain a view of an individual ’s NOUN , PROPN VERB the chromosomes and then cut and VERB each chromosome into a NOUN , or PROPN , also known as an NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for instance , PROPN syndrome — which involves ADJ facial features as well as heart and VERB NOUN — is identified by a NOUN on chromosome NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , the NOUN can VERB NOUN , which occur when a segment of genetic material NOUN from NUM chromosome and VERB to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are VERB in certain NOUN , including ADJ NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the long - chain fatty acids and PROPN VERB in the ADJ cells to form NOUN , which aggregate into NOUN and become VERB with proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these large NOUN are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN contain NOUN , NOUN , and other lipids and have proteins on their surface . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ phase begins when NOUN enters the small intestine VERB digestive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this phase controls the rate of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN stimulates the release of stomach acid , or ADJ acid ( PROPN ) which VERB in the NOUN of the proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , when the stomach is VERB , the ADJ environment need not be maintained and a hormone called NOUN VERB the release of ADJ acid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN high in lipids take a long time to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a hormone called ADJ ADJ NOUN is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the ADJ movements of the intestine to allow fatty NOUN more time to be VERB and absorbed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once a signal is received by the NOUN , it then VERB ADV to the cell body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon NOUN that VERB signals from multiple NOUN and serves as a NOUN between the cell body and an axon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an axon is a tube - like structure that VERB the ADJ signal to specialized NOUN called axon NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> along the axon there are ADJ NOUN in the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are called nodes of PROPN and are sites where the signal is “ VERB ” as it VERB along the axon . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB and VERB dead cells and protect the brain from VERB microorganisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , shown in [ link ] b form NOUN NOUN around NOUN in the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is ADJ from the PROPN where a single PROPN cell provides NOUN for only NUM axon as the entire PROPN cell surrounds the axon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN serve as NOUN for developing neurons as they VERB to their end NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN cells line fluid - filled NOUN of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from NOUN to axon NOUN ) is carried by a brief NOUN of the VERB membrane potential called an action potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s NOUN , ion channels open . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as ADJ ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the diffusion of PROPN out of the cell actually VERB the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell 's normal NOUN potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at this point , the sodium channels will return to their VERB state , meaning they are ADJ to open again if the membrane potential again VERB the threshold potential . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fusion of a NOUN with the ADJ membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the ADJ NOUN , the extracellular space between the ADJ and ADJ membranes , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the neurotransmitter VERB across the ADJ NOUN and binds to receptor proteins on the ADJ membrane . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> signal PROPN a single PROPN is strong enough to VERB an action potential in the ADJ neuron , but often multiple ADJ inputs must create NOUN around the same time for the ADJ neuron to be ADV VERB to fire an action potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is called NOUN and occurs at the axon NOUN , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> additionally , NUM neuron often has inputs from many ADJ neurons — some ADJ and some ADJ — so NOUN can VERB out NOUN and vice ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the central nervous system ( PROPN ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with NUM layers of ADJ NOUN called NOUN ( from the greek word for membrane ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the outermost layer is the PROPN NOUN ( latin for “ hard mother ” ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the middle layer is the web - like ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the last layer is the PROPN NOUN ( latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly NOUN and covers the brain and spinal cord like ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the space between the NOUN and PROPN NOUN is filled with ADJ fluid ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it includes the ADJ cortex , ADJ system , basal NOUN , thalamus , hypothalamus , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM different ways that a brain can be VERB in order to view internal structures : a ADJ section cuts the brain left to right , as shown in [ link ] b , a ADJ section cuts the brain front to back , as shown in [ link ] a , and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom . ADJ PROPN outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the ADJ cortex , which is VERB into NOUN called PROPN ( singular : PROPN ) and NOUN called NOUN ( singular : NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cortex is made up of NUM NOUN — right and left — which are separated by a large NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ lobe is located at the top of the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> neurons in the ADJ lobe are involved in speech and also reading . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your NOUN and is primarily involved in processing and NOUN sounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also contains the NOUN ( greek for “ PROPN ” ) — a structure that processes memory formation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the thalamus ( greek for “ inner chamber ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] , acts as a NOUN to and from the cortex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM important structure within the ADJ system is a temporal lobe structure called the NOUN ( greek for “ PROPN ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM NOUN are important both for the NOUN of fear and for VERB ADJ faces . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN , illustrated in [ link ] , VERB the rest of the brain with the spinal cord . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it consists of the NOUN , medulla NOUN , and the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “ fight or flight ” response that occurs when an animal VERB a dangerous situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM way to remember this is to think of the NOUN a person VERB when VERB a NOUN ( “ NOUN ” and “ sympathetic ” both begin with “ s ” ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations , the ADJ nervous system allows an animal to “ rest and VERB . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM way to remember this is to think that during a ADJ situation like a NOUN , the ADJ nervous system is in control ( “ NOUN ” and “ ADJ ” both start with “ p ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ ADJ neurons have cell bodies located in the NOUN and in the ADJ ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ disorders are NOUN characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by ADJ death . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these diseases generally VERB over time as more and more neurons die . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN spectrum disorder ( PROPN ) is a ADJ disorder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its NOUN VERB from person to person . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> major depression affects approximately NUM percent of the adults in the united states each year and is NUM of the most common mental disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to be VERB with major ADJ disorder , a person must have experienced a ADV ADJ mood VERB longer than NUM weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of NOUN in activities that were previously VERB , changes in NOUN and sleep NOUN , difficulty VERB , feelings of NOUN , and ADJ thoughts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is called sensory transduction . there are NUM broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the receptor can then respond to the stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus , be it far away or in contact with the body , is that receptor ’s ADJ field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> think for a moment about the differences in ADJ fields for the different senses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perception is an individual ’s interpretation of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although perception VERB on the NOUN of sensory receptors , perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor , but at higher levels in the nervous system , in the brain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN , ( shown in [ link ] ) also known as ADJ NOUN , are found in the upper NOUN , but they project into the epidermis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they , too , are found primarily in the ADJ skin on the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> neurons are not ADV connected , but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into NOUN or “ NOUN ” between VERB neurons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> muscle NOUN are ADJ receptors that detect the amount of NOUN , or NOUN of muscles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> related to these are PROPN NOUN organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , or hearing , is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger , such as an VERB NOUN , and to participate in ADJ NOUN like those VERB NOUN or mating . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , ADJ part of the ear called the NOUN , then travel through the auditory canal and cause NOUN of the thin NOUN called the NOUN or ear NOUN , the ADJ part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> interior to the NOUN is the middle ear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the middle ear holds NUM small bones called the NOUN , which transfer energy from the moving NOUN to the inner ear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the mechanical energy from the moving NOUN VERB the NOUN to the NUM bones of the middle ear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the NOUN to a thin NOUN called the ADJ NOUN , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the structures of the inner ear are found in the NOUN , a bony , ADJ structure that is the most interior portion of the ear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cochlea is a ADJ structure , like the shell of a NOUN , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> inside the cochlea , the ADJ membrane is a mechanical NOUN that runs the length of the cochlea , VERB toward the cochlea ’s center . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the site of transduction is in the organ of PROPN ( ADJ organ ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is composed of hair cells held in place above the ADJ membrane like flowers VERB up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like NOUN VERB or embedded in the ADJ membrane above them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single NOUN , VERB approximately NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> wave amplitude is perceived as ADJ intensity , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the standard unit of intensity of light is the PROPN , which is approximately the ADJ intensity of a NUM common NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN , the front ADJ layer of the eye , and the ADJ lens , a ADJ ADJ structure behind the NOUN , both VERB ( VERB ) light to focus the image on the retina . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , which is ADJ as the colored part of the eye , is a circular ADJ ring VERB between the lens and NOUN that VERB the amount of light entering the eye . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in conditions of high ADJ light , the PROPN NOUN , reducing the size of the NOUN at its center . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for both NOUN , images in the distance are clear but images ADV are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( NOUN ) occurs when an NOUN is ADJ and the image focus falls in front of the retina . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , images in the distance are ADJ but images ADV are clear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both NOUN and cones contain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in vertebrates , the main NOUN , PROPN , has NUM main parts [ link ] ) : an NOUN , which is a membrane protein ( in the form of a NOUN of α - NOUN that VERB the membrane ) , and ADJ — a molecule that VERB light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when light VERB a NOUN , it causes a shape change in the ADJ , VERB its structure from a ADJ ( PROPN ) form of the molecule to its linear ( PROPN ) PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the ADJ NOUN in the NOUN , where eye movements are VERB and VERB with auditory information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the NOUN nucleus ( PROPN ) of the hypothalamus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is a NOUN of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal NOUN , which controls our ADJ ( day - long ) cycle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first NUM NOUN need little explanation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of NOUN as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently — it was identified in NUM by japanese scientist PROPN PROPN while he worked with NOUN NOUN , but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be ADV ADJ until many years later . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the taste of NOUN , also known as NOUN , is ADJ to the taste of the amino acid l - NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall that sensory cells are neurons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an olfactory receptor , which is a NOUN of a specialized neuron , VERB when it binds certain molecules VERB from the environment by VERB NOUN directly to the olfactory NOUN of the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> humans have about NUM NUM olfactory receptors , VERB among NOUN of different receptor types that respond to different NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the primary organ of taste is the taste NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a taste NOUN is a NOUN of ADJ receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the NOUN on the NOUN called NOUN ( singular : NOUN ) ( illustrated in [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are several ADV distinct NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most ADJ hormones are derived from NOUN and thus are ADV similar to it , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the primary class of ADJ hormones in humans is the NOUN hormones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the structure of NOUN hormones is that of a polypeptide chain ( chain of amino acids ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide NOUN , such as ADJ hormone and NOUN produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this way , nothing passes through the cell membrane ; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hormone that VERB the signaling pathway is called a first NOUN , which VERB a second NOUN in the cytoplasm , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this way , a small amount of hormone can VERB the formation of a large amount of cellular product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to stop hormone activity , camp is VERB by the ADJ enzyme NOUN , or PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is always present in the cell and VERB down camp to control hormone activity , preventing NOUN of cellular products . the specific response of a cell to a ADJ ADJ hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some cases , the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones , which is referred to as ADJ stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that in a short - term stress response , the hormones NOUN and NOUN are important for providing the NOUN of energy required for the body to respond . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the hypothalamus contains ADJ centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via ADJ control . the pituitary gland , sometimes called the NOUN or “ PROPN gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the PROPN PROPN , a NOUN of the PROPN bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is attached to the hypothalamus via a NOUN called the pituitary NOUN ( or PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release - VERB hormones produced by the hypothalamus , and the posterior pituitary receives signals via ADJ cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a part of the brain , VERB down from the hypothalamus , and contains mostly nerve fibers and NOUN cells , which support NOUN that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the thyroid gland is made up of many ADJ thyroid NOUN , which are VERB with a simple ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN contain a ADJ fluid , called NOUN , which stores the NOUN PROPN , the NOUN to the thyroid hormones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN produce hormones that can be stored in the NOUN or released into the surrounding capillary network for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this outcome suggests that technology has created new NOUN for ADJ material to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the children ’s internet protection act , however , requires PROPN schools and public NOUN receiving internet access using special e - rate NOUN to VERB or block access to ADJ material and other material VERB ADJ to NOUN , with certain NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there has been increased conflict over the second amendment in recent years due to school NOUN and gun violence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , gun rights have become a highly charged political issue . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the third amendment says in full : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , the courts have found that police do not generally need a NOUN to search the NOUN NOUN of a car ( [ link ] ) , or to search people entering the united states from another country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> see , for example , arizona v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a NOUN is needed , law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a NOUN , but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is ADJ cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ cause is the legal standard for determining whether a search or NOUN is constitutional or a crime has been committed ; it is a lower threshold than the standard of NOUN at a criminal trial . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many of the provisions VERB with the rights of the VERB are included in the fifth amendment ; ADV , it is NUM of the ADJ in the bill of rights . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fifth amendment states in full : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps the most famous provision of the fifth amendment is its protection against self - NOUN , or the right to remain ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this provision is so well known that we have a NOUN for it : “ taking the fifth . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> people have the right not to give evidence in court or to law enforcement officers that might VERB an NOUN of NOUN or responsibility for a crime . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the greatest recent NOUN over economic liberty has been VERB by cities ’ and states ’ use of the power of ADJ NOUN to take property for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> traditionally , the main use of ADJ NOUN was to obtain property for transportation NOUN like NOUN , NOUN , NOUN and NOUN , and NOUN , which require fairly straight NOUN to be efficient . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most people VERB of crimes decline their right to a NOUN trial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this choice is typically the result of a NOUN NOUN , an agreement between the NOUN and the NOUN in which the NOUN VERB ADJ to the charge ( s ) in question , or perhaps to less ADJ charges , in exchange for more ADJ punishment than he or she might receive if VERB after a full trial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are a number of reasons why this might happen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN amendment says , in full : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN amendment is as follows : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although several state NOUN do list the right to privacy as a protected right , the explicit recognition by the supreme court of a right to privacy in the u.s. constitution emerged only in the middle of the twentieth century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the court VERB out the right to privacy for the first time in PROPN v. PROPN , a case that struck down a state law VERB even married individuals to use any form of NOUN . PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) although many subsequent cases before the supreme court also VERB with privacy in the course of ADJ , sexual conduct , the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of NOUN and NOUN by government and private parties of our activities , movements , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both these senses of privacy are VERB below . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> beyond the issues of NOUN and abortion , the right to privacy has been VERB to VERB a more general right for adults to have ADJ , ADJ sexual relationships in private . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , this legal development is relatively new ; as recently as NUM , the supreme court ruled that states could still VERB sex acts between NUM people of the same sex . PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that decision was VERB in NUM in PROPN v. texas , which VERB state laws that VERB NOUN . PROPN v. texas , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the proclamation that “ all men are created equal ” appears in the declaration of independence , and the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the u.s. constitution requires that the federal government treat people equally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to chief justice PROPN warren in the supreme court case of PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) , “ discrimination may be so ADJ as to be ADJ of due process . NOUN v. PROPN , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> discrimination based on gender or sex is generally VERB with intermediate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the standard of intermediate NOUN was first applied by the supreme court in PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) and again in PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) ; PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it requires the government to demonstrate that VERB men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental NOUN . ” this VERB the burden of NOUN on the government to demonstrate why the ADJ treatment is ADJ , not on the individual who VERB ADJ discrimination has taken place . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> clearly , then , new civil rights issues can VERB over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how can we , as citizens , identify them as they VERB and distinguish ADJ claims of discrimination from claims by those who have ADV been unable to VERB a majority to agree with their NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the spread of slavery into the west VERB ADJ , however , following the supreme court ’s ruling in the case PROPN scott v. PROPN , PROPN scott v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> decided in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scott , who had been born into slavery but had spent time in free states and NOUN , argued that his ADJ NOUN in a territory where slavery had been VERB by the federal government had made him a free man . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> new york : PROPN & PROPN , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although at the beginning of the war president abraham lincoln had been willing to allow slavery to continue in the south to preserve the union , he changed his policies regarding NOUN over the course of the war . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first step was the NOUN of the PROPN proclamation on january NUM , NUM ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although it stated “ all NOUN held as slaves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the changes VERB by the fourteenth amendment were more extensive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to VERB the equal protection clause to the constitution , this amendment also extended the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the states , required the states to respect the NOUN or NOUN of all citizens , and , for the first time , defined NOUN at the national and state levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps the most famous of the tools of NOUN were NOUN tests and understanding tests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN tests , which had been used in the north since the NUM to VERB VERB european immigrants from voting , called on the ADJ voter to demonstrate his ( and later her ) ability to read a particular passage of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> w. e. b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , however , argued for a more ADJ approach and in NUM founded the national association for the PROPN of colored people ( PROPN ) as a NOUN point for VERB equality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> liberal whites dominated the organization in its early years , but african americans VERB control over its NOUN in the NUM . PROPN : NUM years of history , ” X ( april NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a few months later , in little rock , PROPN , governor PROPN PROPN VERB court - VERB integration and VERB national PROPN troops to keep black students out of central high school . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president PROPN then called up the PROPN national PROPN for federal NOUN ( essentially taking the troops out of PROPN ’s hands ) and sent soldiers of the PROPN PROPN division to VERB students to and from classes , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN : NOUN , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new PROPN , PROPN : PROPN university press , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of PROPN v. PROPN ( NUM ) , the supreme court held that while such NOUN did not VERB the fourteenth amendment because they VERB of agreements between private citizens , their provisions could not be VERB by courts . PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because state courts are government institutions and the fourteenth amendment VERB the government from VERB people equal protection of the law , the courts ’ enforcement of such NOUN would be a NOUN of the amendment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , if a white family VERB to sell its house to a black family and the other NOUN in the NOUN tried to VERB the seller , the court would not hear the case . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these ADJ groups VERB to prefer more ADJ NOUN , including the use of direct action campaigns VERB on NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the strategies of ADJ resistance and civil NOUN , or the NOUN to VERB an ADJ law , had been effective in the campaign led by PROPN PROPN to VERB colonial PROPN from british rule in the 1930s and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> civil rights NOUN adopted these measures in the NUM PROPN NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> democratic primary candidate PROPN PROPN VERB in PROPN on august NUM , NUM , to give a speech at a NOUN to promote his presidential campaign . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , the NOUN was VERB — and eventually VERB - ADJ — by NOUN for black lives matter ( [ PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ black lives matter NOUN VERB down PROPN event in PROPN , ” PROPN , NUM august NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why did the group risk VERB democratic voters by preventing PROPN from speaking ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> because black lives matter had been trying to raise awareness of the treatment of black citizens in the united states , and the media has the power to VERB such issues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM ( august NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while some VERB its NOUN , the organization ’s move VERB how important the media are to VERB recognition , and the NOUN to which organizations are willing to go to get media attention . PROPN PROPN , “ a NOUN about black lives matter and PROPN PROPN , ” the PROPN , NUM august NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the media also VERB in agenda setting , which is the act of VERB which issues or topics VERB public discussion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in the early 1980s , NOUN in PROPN VERB worldwide attention , which resulted in increased ADJ giving to the country . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although newspapers united for a common cause during the revolutionary war , the NOUN that occurred during the constitutional convention and the united states ’ early history created a change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the federalist papers , as well as the anti - federalist papers , in the NOUN , moved the nation into the party press era , in which NOUN and political party NOUN dominated the choice of ADJ content . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM reason was cost . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , PROPN PROPN VERB the new york times with the goal of creating a ADJ NOUN that would provide NOUN with important news about the economy , politics , and the world rather than NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the new york times brought back the ADJ model , which VERB NOUN and NOUN and VERB NOUN in government and politics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the chain NOUN method involves dna replication of a single - VERB template with the use of a NOUN and a ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) , which is a NOUN , or a single unit , of dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN and NOUN are VERB with a small NOUN of ADV labeled PROPN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN are NOUN that are VERB a NOUN group ( – INTJ ) at the site at which another nucleotide usually VERB to form a chain ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this was sufficient for sequencing small genomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the NOUN to sequence larger genomes , such as that of a human , led to the development of double - NOUN NOUN sequencing , more ADV known as NOUN - end sequencing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN - end sequencing , both ends of each NOUN are VERB for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> having entire genomes VERB helps with the research efforts in these model organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process of VERB biological information to gene sequences is called genome NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology , such as VERB PROPN NOUN and rna NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although mrna analysis is a step in the right direction , not all PROPN are VERB into proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the study of the function of NOUN is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB NOUN and is useful when scientists want to test their NOUN that were based on genes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such NOUN only account for approximately NUM percent of diseases in developed countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most of the common diseases , such as heart disease , are ADJ - ADJ or ADJ , which is a NOUN characteristic that involves NUM or more genes , and also involve environmental factors such as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in april NUM , scientists at PROPN university published the genome analysis of a healthy individual ( PROPN PROPN , a scientist at PROPN university , who had his genome VERB ) ; the analysis VERB his NOUN to VERB various diseases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists describe groups of organisms becoming VERB to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or VERB the “ fit ” of the population to its environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> over time , evolution led to changes in the shapes and NOUN of these bones in different species , but they have maintained the same overall NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists call these ADJ parts homologous structures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a species is a group of individual organisms that VERB and produce ADJ , ADJ offspring . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this definition , NUM species is VERB from another when , in nature , it is not possible for NOUN between individuals from each species to produce ADJ offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into NUM broad categories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN ( PROPN = " other " ; ADJ = " NOUN " ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN ( ADJ = " same " ; X = " NOUN " ) involves NOUN occurring within a parent species remaining in NUM location . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> over time , the ADJ demands of their new NOUN lead to multiple NOUN events VERB from a single species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called adaptive radiation because many NOUN VERB from a single point of origin ; thus , causing the species to VERB into several new ones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> island NOUN like the PROPN PROPN provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to ADJ NOUN for many organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> given enough time , the genetic and ADJ NOUN between populations will affect NOUN that influence reproduction : if individuals of the NUM populations were to be brought together , mating would be less likely , but if mating occurred , offspring would be non - ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many types of VERB NOUN may affect the reproductive NOUN , the ability to VERB , of the NUM populations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year , often just ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> differences in VERB NOUN , called temporal NOUN , can act as a form of reproductive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NUM species of NOUN VERB the same area , but one VERB from january to march , whereas the other VERB from march to may ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NUM related NOUN species exhibit temporal reproductive NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other ADJ barriers work when differences in their NOUN cells ( eggs and sperm ) prevent fertilization from taking place ; this is called a ADJ barrier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , in some cases closely related organisms try to mate , but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the ADJ evolution of populations and species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the theory also VERB this change of a population over time , called NOUN , with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher ADJ groups with widely ADJ NOUN , called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way , meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele , while ADJ mutations may be ADV VERB if derived from a dominant allele from the gene NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gene NOUN is the sum of all the alleles in a population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> populations with NUM or more variations of particular characteristics are called ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the distribution of NOUN among individuals , known as the population variation , is influenced by a number of factors , including the population ’s genetic structure and the environment ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> understanding the sources of a ADJ variation in a population is important for determining how a population will VERB in response to different evolutionary pressures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when scientists are involved in the NOUN of a species , such as with animals in NOUN and nature NOUN , they try to increase a population ’s genetic NOUN to preserve as much of the ADJ diversity as they can . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this also helps reduce the NOUN associated with NOUN , the mating of closely related individuals , which can have the ADJ effect of VERB together ADJ recessive mutations that can cause NOUN and NOUN to disease . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a disease that is caused by a rare , recessive allele might exist in a population , but it will only VERB itself when an individual carries NUM NOUN of the allele . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another way a population ’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic NOUN ( [ link ] ) , which is simply the effect of chance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by chance , some individuals will have more offspring than others — not due to an advantage VERB by some ADV - VERB trait , but just because NUM male VERB to be in the right place at the right time ( when the ADJ female VERB by ) or because the other one VERB to be in the ADJ place at the ADJ time ( when a NOUN was VERB ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if individuals PROPN mate with their NOUN , the result can be a changing population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are many reasons ADJ mating occurs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM reason is simple mate choice ; for example , female NOUN may prefer NOUN with ADJ , ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such ADJ variation is seen between most populations and can be significant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM type of geographic variation , called a PROPN , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ADJ gradient . <sent_end> <sent_begin> species of ADJ - ADJ animals , for example , tend to have larger bodies in the ADJ NOUN ADV to the earth ’s NOUN , allowing them to better VERB heat . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , it is not the absolute NOUN of an individual that VERB , but rather how it VERB to the other organisms in the population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this concept , called relative NOUN , allows researchers to determine which individuals are VERB additional offspring to the next generation , and thus , how the population might VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes NUM or more distinct NOUN can each have their NOUN and be selected for by natural selection , while the intermediate NOUN are , on average , less fit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> known as VERB selection ( [ link ] ) , this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> large , dominant NOUN males obtain NOUN by ADJ force , while small males can VERB in for ADJ NOUN with the females in an NOUN male ’s territory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is that large NOUN carry risk , and only the best males survive that risk : the ADJ the tail , the more fit the male . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this idea is known as the NOUN principle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in scientific terms , the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN describes the relationships of an organism , such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved , to which species it is most closely related , and so ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a VERB tree , the VERB indicates evolutionary relationships ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single NOUN evolved into a distinct new one . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN that evolved early from the root and remains ADJ is called basal NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when NUM NOUN stem from the same branch point , they are called sister NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a branch with more than NUM NOUN is called a NOUN and serves to VERB where scientists have not ADV determined all of the relationships . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is important to note that although sister NOUN and PROPN do share an NOUN , it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , after the common beginning of all life , scientists divide organisms into NUM large categories called a NOUN : bacteria , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> within each NOUN is a second category called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after NOUN , the subsequent categories of increasing NOUN are : phylum , class , order , family , NOUN , and species ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , the scientific name of the NOUN is PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the name at each level is also called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , dogs are in order PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how do scientists VERB ADJ trees ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> after the homologous and ADJ traits are VERB , scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this system VERB organisms into NOUN : groups of organisms that VERB from a single NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> now consider the NOUN egg characteristic in the same figure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> only some of the organisms in [ link ] have this trait , and to those that do , it is called a shared derived NOUN because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the NOUN in the tree . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ aspect to shared ADJ and shared derived NOUN is the fact that these terms are relative . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the same trait can be considered NUM or the other depending on the particular diagram being used . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more recently , a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered . <sent_end> <sent_begin> small , virus - like particles called gene transfer NOUN ( NOUN ) transfer random ADJ NOUN from NUM species of NOUN to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes , sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleus - first hypothesis VERB that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link ] a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new NOUN with bacteria that became mitochondria . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mitochondria - first hypothesis VERB that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link ] b ) , which ADV acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most ADV , the NOUN - first hypothesis VERB that prokaryotes actually evolved from NOUN by VERB genes and NOUN ( [ link ] c ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> others have proposed VERB any tree - like model of NOUN in favor of a ring structure , the so - called “ ring of life ” ( [ link ] ) ; a ADJ model where all NUM NOUN of life evolved from a NOUN of ADJ prokaryotes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> lake , again using the conditioned reconstruction NOUN , VERB a ring - like model in which species of all NUM NOUN — NOUN , bacteria , and PROPN — evolved from a single NOUN of gene - VERB prokaryotes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they therefore lack most of the components of cells , such as organelles , NOUN , and the plasma membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN consists of a nucleic acid core , an outer protein NOUN or NOUN , and sometimes an outer NOUN made of protein and NOUN membranes derived from the host cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> viruses may also contain additional proteins , such as enzymes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many viruses use some NOUN of NOUN to VERB to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for these viruses , attachment is a requirement for later NOUN of the cell membrane , so they can complete their replication inside the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> group i viruses contain double - VERB dna ( PROPN ) as their genome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their mrna is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular dna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN separate , and NUM of them is used as a template for the generation of mrna using the rna - dependent rna polymerase VERB by the virus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group PROPN viruses have PRON as their genome with a positive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> positive NOUN means that the ADJ rna can serve directly as mrna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> multiple , full - length rna NOUN of negative NOUN ( ADJ to the positive - VERB ADJ rna ) are formed from these NOUN , which may then serve as NOUN for the production of rna with positive NOUN , including both full - length ADJ rna and shorter viral NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group v viruses contain X genomes with a negative NOUN , meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mrna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as with group PROPN viruses , NUM NOUN are used to make NOUN of the genome and produce mrna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> viruses can VERB only certain species of NOUN and only certain cells within that host . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells that a virus may use to VERB are called ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for most viruses , the molecular basis for this NOUN is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and VERB the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many animal viruses , such as PROPN ( human NOUN virus ) , leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as VERB , where NOUN leave the cell ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the ADJ process , the cell does not undergo NOUN and is not immediately killed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are viruses that VERB bacteria ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when infection of a cell by a NOUN results in the production of new NOUN , the infection is said to be productive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the NOUN are released by VERB the cell , the virus VERB by means of a ADJ cycle ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , when a ADJ NOUN VERB a bacterial cell , it VERB by means of a ADJ cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is VERB into the genome of the host cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the NOUN dna is VERB into the host cell genome , it is called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of a ADJ NOUN is the λ ( NOUN ) virus , which also VERB the e . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you will learn in the next NOUN , animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of them follow the ADJ pattern of ADJ disease , where symptoms get increasingly ADJ for a short period followed by the NOUN of the virus from the body by the immune system and ADJ recovery from the infection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples of ADJ viral diseases are the common cold and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some animal - VERB viruses , including the NOUN c virus discussed above , are known as ADJ viruses : they have the ability to cause cancer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these viruses VERB with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either VERB genes that stimulate ADJ cell growth ( NOUN ) or by VERB with the expression of genes that VERB cell growth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM common NOUN is NOUN , the ADJ NOUN of cells that causes the appearance of plant NOUN known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other viruses VERB NOUN , or VERB cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> still other viruses affect the plant by directly VERB plant cells , a process known as cell NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the danger of using live NOUN , which are usually more effective than killed NOUN , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will VERB to their disease - causing form by back mutations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> live NOUN are usually made by VERB ( VERB ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the NOUN in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is VERB to in the host . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another medical use for viruses VERB on their NOUN and ability to VERB the cells they VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ viruses are VERB in the NOUN specifically to attack and VERB cancer cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADV modified NOUN known as PROPN has been used since NUM in ADJ NOUN in china to treat head and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , so - called because they are ADJ , are ADJ particles — smaller than viruses — that contain no nucleic acids ( neither dna nor rna ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , the idea of an ADJ NOUN that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible , but ADJ work by PROPN PROPN - VERB NOUN PROPN PROPN has VERB the majority of NOUN that such NOUN do indeed exist . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some prokaryotes VERB in environments that are ADJ for most living things . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prokaryotes VERB nutrients — essential substances ( such as carbon and nitrogen ) — and they drive the evolution of new ecosystems , some of which are natural and others man - made . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prokaryotes have been on earth since long before multicellular life appeared . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — ADJ organisms — were able to live . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ organisms that convert ADJ energy into chemical energy are called PROPN , and they appeared within NUM NUM years of the formation of earth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> then , NOUN , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple ADJ NUM NUM years later . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , a NOUN lake is both ADJ and ADJ , so organisms that live in a NOUN lake must be both NOUN and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other NOUN , like ADJ organisms , do not prefer an extreme environment ( in this case , NUM with high levels of radiation ) , but have VERB to survive in it ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this model , however , does not reflect the true NOUN of prokaryotes , most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a ADJ community ( [ link ] ) held together in a NOUN - VERB matrix that consists primarily of NOUN secreted by the organisms , together with some proteins and nucleic acids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN grow attached to surfaces . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> bacterial cell walls contain ADJ , composed of ADJ NOUN that are cross - linked by unusual NOUN containing both l - and d - amino acids including d - NOUN acid and d - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> proteins normally have only l - amino acids ; as a NOUN , many of our NOUN work by VERB d - amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN - positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in PROPN - negative organisms ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> up to NUM percent of the cell wall in PROPN - positive bacteria is composed of NOUN , and most of the rest is composed of ADJ substances called ADJ acids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ acids may be ADV linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form ADJ acids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a ADJ NOUN takes up dna for a NOUN gene from a pathogen and VERB the new dna into its own chromosome , it too may become ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in transduction , NOUN , the viruses that VERB bacteria , sometimes also move short NOUN of ADJ dna from NUM NOUN to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> transduction results in a ADJ organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the largest NOUN of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is ADJ nitrogen from the air , but this nitrogen is not ADJ by plants , which are primary producers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more ADV available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . another source of ammonia is NOUN , the process by which ammonia is released during the NOUN of nitrogen - containing organic compounds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN in soils is carried out by bacteria VERB to the NOUN PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bacteria VERB the reverse process , the reduction of NOUN from the soils to ADJ compounds such as PROPN , no , and PROPN , a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> art connection <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a widespread , usually worldwide , NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ disease is a disease that is ADV present , usually at low NOUN , in a population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> researchers have expressed concern about the way this ADJ source of PROPN VERB a much ADJ population than those VERB in care NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the journal of the american medical association reported that , among PROPN - VERB NOUN in healthcare NOUN , the average age is NUM , whereas people with “ community - associated PROPN ” ( PROPN - PROPN ) have an average age of NUM <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN electron NOUN shows NOUN - ADJ PROPN NOUN bacteria , commonly known as PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> s . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a NOUN of bacteria that carries a set of similar NOUN on its cell surface , and there are often many different NOUN of a bacterial species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most e . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to the united nations convention on biological diversity , NOUN is “ any technological application that uses biological systems , living organisms , or NOUN ADV , to make or VERB products or processes for specific use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " NUM the concept of “ specific use ” involves some NOUN of commercial application . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and some other ADJ NOUN species VERB particles by a process called NOUN , in which the cell membrane VERB a food particle and VERB it ADV , VERB off an intracellular ADJ sac , or NOUN , called a food NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN containing the VERB particle , the NOUN , then VERB with a NOUN containing ADJ enzymes to produce a NOUN , and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can VERB into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ remains ultimately are VERB from the cell via NOUN . the stages of NOUN include the NOUN of a food particle , the NOUN of the particle using ADJ enzymes VERB within a NOUN , and the NOUN of ADJ materials from the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second PROPN NOUN , the PROPN , also VERB semi - functional mitochondria . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN , these structures function ADV and are called PROPN because they produce hydrogen gas as a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN move with NOUN and membrane VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a result , the carbon dioxide that the NOUN had VERB and VERB into their cells during photosynthesis is not VERB to the atmosphere . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in general , this process by which carbon is transported deep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon NOUN , because carbon is “ VERB ” to the ocean NOUN where it is ADJ to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the biological carbon NOUN is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that VERB lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ body of a NOUN is a ADJ or multicellular NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN fungi can change from the NOUN to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ stage consists of a NOUN of ADJ NOUN - like structures called NOUN ( singular , NOUN ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mass of NOUN is a NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it can grow on a surface , in soil or VERB material , in a liquid , or even on living tissue . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fungi are mostly PROPN ( PROPN is an ADJ term ) : organisms that VERB nutrients from VERB organic matter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they obtain their nutrients from dead or VERB organic matter : mainly plant material . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during sexual reproduction , NUM mating types are produced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when both mating types are present in the same NOUN , it is called PROPN , or self - ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN require NUM different , but ADJ , NOUN to reproduce ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , during PROPN ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , NUM haploid cells fuse , leading to a ADJ stage where NUM haploid nuclei VERB in a single cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during PROPN ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , meiosis takes place in the PROPN ( singular , NOUN ) organs , in which gametes of different mating types are generated . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM VERB mating NOUN ( type + and type – ) must be in close NOUN for PROPN from the NOUN to be produced and fuse , leading to PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the developing diploid NOUN have thick NOUN that protect them from NOUN and other NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they may remain ADJ until environmental conditions are ADJ . <sent_end>

NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these papers included materials from a secret history of the vietnam war that had been VERB by the military . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more specifically , the papers were VERB at the NOUN of secretary of defense robert PROPN and provided a study of u.s. political and military involvement in vietnam from NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> daniel PROPN famously released NOUN of the papers to the press to show that the united states had ADV VERB the NOUN of the war by VERB PROPN and PROPN among other NOUN while VERB to the american public about doing so . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , the courts have recognized that government officials and other public NOUN might try to VERB press NOUN and avoid ADJ news coverage by VERB a NOUN for NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NUM new york times v. PROPN case , the supreme court decided that public NOUN needed to demonstrate not only that a negative press statement about them was ADJ but also that the statement was published or made with either ADJ NOUN or “ ADJ NOUN ” for the NOUN . new york times v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ruling made it much ADV for politicians to VERB potential NOUN or to VERB their political opponents through the courts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this allows for exchange of chemical NOUN between the different cell types . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the NOUN VERB NOUN of the loop of PROPN has NOUN of cells called PROPN PROPN , which are in contact with cells of the ADJ NOUN called ADJ cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , the NOUN PROPN and PROPN cells form the ADJ complex ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are similar to NOUN cells in that they have a NOUN with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs through a NOUN called the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are more evolved than the NOUN cells in that they have a system for ADJ NOUN by a capillary network before NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> excess nitrogen is VERB from the body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN tend to form ADJ ammonia , which VERB the NOUN of body fluids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of atp and large quantities of water to VERB it out of a biological system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN use NOUN acid NOUN as an NOUN in their cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , too much NOUN acid tends to form kidney NOUN and may also cause a ADJ condition called NOUN , where NOUN acid NOUN VERB in the joints , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the immune system VERB both innate and adaptive immune responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> innate NOUN occurs naturally because of genetic factors or NOUN ; it is not induced by infection or NOUN but works to reduce the NOUN for the adaptive immune response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins , receptor - VERB signaling , and ADJ cell - to - cell communication . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a large ADJ cell that VERB foreign particles and pathogens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN recognize NOUN via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are molecules on NOUN and ADJ cells which are in contact with the external environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second class of early - acting NOUN is NOUN , which are released by infected cells as a NOUN to ADJ ADJ cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the functions of an NOUN is to VERB viral replication . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they also have other important functions , such as NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have a nucleus with NUM to NUM NOUN , and they contain organelles , called NOUN , that VERB ADJ pathogens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a NOUN that works with other NOUN to VERB a NOUN ; it is involved in the ADJ response and in protection against PROPN ( ADJ NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> lymphocytes are NOUN that are ADV ADJ by their large , ADV VERB nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> infected cells are identified and VERB by natural NOUN ( PROPN ) cells , lymphocytes that can VERB cells infected with viruses or NOUN cells ( ADJ cells that ADV divide and VERB other tissue ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> t cells are lymphocytes that mature in the NOUN gland , and b cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN cells identify intracellular NOUN , especially from viruses , by the VERB expression of major NOUN class ( PROPN ) i molecules on the surface of infected cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN i molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all VERB cells , thus they are ADJ on red blood cells and NOUN which are non - ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN are released along with the PROPN in the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a PROPN is a NOUN that VERB cellular proteins and VERB the target cell to undergo VERB cell death , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ cells then VERB the cell NOUN left behind . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the adaptive , or acquired , immune response takes days or even weeks to become established — much longer than the innate response ; however , adaptive NOUN is more specific to pathogens and has memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> adaptive NOUN is an NOUN that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is ADJ to control an infection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the innate immune system contains cells that detect ADV ADJ NOUN , and then VERB the adaptive immune response about the presence of these NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an antigen - VERB cell ( PROPN ) is an immune cell that VERB , VERB , and VERB the adaptive immune response about an infection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a pathogen is VERB , these NOUN will VERB the pathogen and VERB it to form many different fragments of the antigen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these molecules are important because they regulate how a t cell will interact with and respond to an PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ PROPN + cells bind NOUN via their antigen - embedded PROPN ii molecules and are stimulated to become NOUN t ( NOUN ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate b cells ( or ADJ t cells ) directly or secrete NOUN to VERB more and various target cells about the ADJ threat . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , PROPN + cells engage antigen - embedded PROPN i molecules on NOUN and are stimulated to become ADJ t lymphocytes ( NOUN ) , which directly VERB infected cells by NOUN and VERB NOUN to VERB the immune response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a PROPN cell VERB that a b cell is bound to a ADJ antigen , it VERB specific NOUN that VERB the b cell to VERB rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( ADJ ) NOUN of it , and then it VERB and VERB NOUN with the same antigen recognition pattern as the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of b cells VERB to NUM specific NOUN NOUN and the dramatic NOUN of that NOUN is known as ADJ selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this phenomenon ADV , but ADV , changes the NOUN of NOUN NOUN expressed by the immune system , and shifts the balance toward NOUN specific to the VERB pathogen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the immune system has to be regulated to prevent ADJ , ADJ responses to ADJ substances , and more ADV so that it does not attack “ self . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the acquired ability to prevent an ADJ or ADJ immune response to a VERB foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> immune NOUN is crucial for VERB ADJ NOUN given the ADJ number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that NOUN of the ADJ cavity , NOUN , and ADJ ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a memory cell is an antigen - specific b or t NOUN that does not VERB into ADJ cells during the primary immune response , but that can immediately become ADJ cells upon re - exposure to the same pathogen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the primary immune response , memory cells do not respond to NOUN and do not contribute to host NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease NOUN can VERB blood to a ADJ NOUN and VERB ADJ NOUN through NOUN in the NOUN ’s blood NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this phenomenon is called ADJ NOUN ; it also occurs naturally during NOUN , which makes VERB NOUN highly ADJ to NOUN during the first few months of life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because an NOUN VERB to such a small region ( the surface area of about NUM to NUM amino acids ) , it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular NOUN and NOUN over short regions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cross NOUN describes when an NOUN binds not to the antigen that VERB its synthesis and NOUN , but to a different antigen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN acts on PROPN , which is made in the liver and VERB it to NOUN PROPN NOUN VERB enzyme ( PROPN ) VERB NOUN i to PROPN ii . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as previously discussed , ADJ hormone or PROPN ( also called NOUN ) , as the name suggests , helps the body VERB water when body fluid volume , especially that of blood , is low . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ immune responses toward ADJ foreign substances or self NOUN that occur after tissue NOUN are termed NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the types of NOUN include immediate , VERB , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most types of NOUN involve the ADJ immune response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN that ADV VERB self components as foreign are termed NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in patients with the ADJ disease NOUN X , muscle cell receptors that VERB contraction in response to NOUN are VERB by NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , also called ADJ NOUN , occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some ADJ , ADJ - ADJ organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after a period of growth , an organism VERB into NUM separate organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is a form of ADJ reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid , depending on the process and the species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , VERB eggs are laid outside the female ’s body and develop there , receiving NOUN from the NOUN that is a part of the egg . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this occurs in most bony fish , many NOUN , some ADJ fish , most NOUN , NUM mammals , and all birds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when they are released from the NOUN , they travel to the ADJ tubes for fertilization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some insects have a specialized sac , called a PROPN , which stores sperm for later use , sometimes up to a year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> fertilization can be VERB with environmental or food conditions that are ADJ for offspring survival . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the male reproductive system , the NOUN houses the NOUN or NOUN ( singular : NOUN ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , NOUN , and muscles related to ADJ function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN is approximately NUM by NUM NOUN ( NUM by NUM in ) in size and divided into NOUN - shaped NOUN by connective tissue called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these are the ADJ vesicles , the NOUN gland , and the ADJ gland , all of which are illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ vesicles are a pair of glands that VERB along the posterior NOUN of the ADJ bladder . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the glands make a solution that is thick , ADJ , and ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ gland , or PROPN ’s gland , releases its NOUN prior to the release of the NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB any acid NOUN in the NOUN left over from NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN VERB from the same tissue that produces the NOUN in a male . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN are thin NOUN of tissue ADV located within the NOUN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN protect the NOUN to the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is a ADJ tube that serves several purposes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it allows ADJ flow to leave the body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus VERB a NOUN - releasing hormone ( PROPN ) to the anterior pituitary . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this causes the release of NOUN stimulating hormone ( PROPN ) and ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that the body must reach NOUN in order for the NOUN to release the hormones that must be present for PROPN to be produced . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during NOUN , stimulates NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these secondary sex characteristics include a NOUN of the voice , the growth of facial , ADJ , and ADJ hair , and the NOUN of the sex drive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these include NOUN development , VERB of the NOUN , and a shorter period necessary for bone NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB in ADJ re - growth and NOUN of PROPN and PROPN release . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to ensure that no more than NUM sperm VERB the egg , once the ADJ reactions take place at NUM location of the egg membrane , the egg releases proteins in other NOUN to prevent other sperm from VERB with the egg . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if this mechanism VERB , multiple sperm can fuse with the egg , resulting in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting embryo is not ADV ADJ and VERB within a few days . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in mammals , the NOUN forms the NOUN in the next stage of development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here the cells in the NOUN VERB themselves in NUM layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the inner cell mass is also known as the NOUN and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the outer layers of the zygote ( NOUN ) grow into the NOUN by VERB the ADJ cells , and VERB NOUN of the NOUN VERB up the NOUN into the tissue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another layer of the NOUN , the NOUN , begins releasing a hormone called human NOUN ADJ NOUN ( β - PROPN ) which makes its way to the PROPN NOUN and VERB that structure active . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB ADJ levels of NOUN that will maintain the NOUN of the NOUN for the support of the developing embryo . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the inability to VERB a child or carry a child to birth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> about NUM percent of causes of NOUN can be identified ; these include diseases , such as ADV transmitted diseases that can cause NOUN of the reproductive tubes in either men or women , or developmental problems frequently related to ADJ hormone levels in NUM of the individuals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN that VERB on either side of the ADJ ADJ tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ pattern of gene expression VERB the NOUN into groups of cells called NOUN with spaces between them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , illustrated in [ link ] will further develop into the NOUN , lungs , and ADJ ( NOUN ) muscle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> questions about ADJ interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN also study interactions among various species ; members of different species are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples of ADJ interactions include NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , competition , and pollination . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the ADJ factors that affect their distribution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ factors such as temperature and NOUN vary based mainly on NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nutrients at the bottom of NOUN are VERB ADV each year : in the spring and fall NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the spring and fall NOUN is a ADJ process that VERB nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a ADJ ecosystem to the top of a body of water ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are caused by the formation of a NOUN : a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> net primary productivity is an NOUN of all of the organic matter available as food ; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is VERB during cellular respiration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in terrestrial environments , net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the ADJ NOUN per unit area , which is the total mass of living plants , VERB roots . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means that a large percentage of plant NOUN which exists ADJ is not included in this measurement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ocean is VERB by several areas or zones ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the ADJ realm ( or zone ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the NOUN to the ADJ parts of the ocean floor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> within the ADJ realm is the ADJ zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can VERB ( approximately NUM m or NUM NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at NOUN greater than NUM m , light can not VERB ; thus , this is referred to as the ADJ zone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the majority of the ocean is ADJ and VERB sufficient light for photosynthesis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the water here contains NOUN and is well - VERB , low in pressure , and stable in temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and VERB PROPN ( a type of free - VERB marine NOUN ) provide a NOUN for some sea life found in the ADJ zone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , NOUN , small fishes , and NOUN are found in the ADJ zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s NOUN . beyond the ADJ zone is the open ocean area known as the ADJ zone ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN that occur where a source of ADJ water , such as a river , VERB the ocean . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , both ADJ water and NOUN water are found in the same NOUN ; VERB results in a ADJ ( ADJ ) NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ features of NOUN and NOUN vary along the length of the river or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN begin at a point of origin referred to as source water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly ADJ during the last NUM years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> global climate change is the term used to describe VERB global NOUN patterns , including a worldwide increase in temperature , due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN gases are probably the most significant NOUN of the climate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when heat energy from the sun VERB the earth , gases known as NOUN gases VERB the heat in the atmosphere , as do the glass NOUN of a NOUN keep heat from VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN gases that affect earth include carbon dioxide , NOUN , water vapor , ADJ NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> populations consist all of the species living within a specific area , and populations VERB based on a number of factors : ADJ and ADJ changes in the environment , natural NOUN such as NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN , and competition for resources between and within species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the statistical study of population dynamics , NOUN , uses a series of ADJ tools to VERB how populations respond to changes in their ADJ and ADJ environments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are VERB after ADJ NOUN used by the insurance industry for VERB human life NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> life NOUN may include the probability of individuals VERB before their next NOUN ( i.e. , their NOUN rate ) , the percentage of VERB individuals VERB at a particular age NOUN , and their life NOUN at each NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of a life NOUN is shown in [ link ] from a study of PROPN NOUN NOUN , a species native to ADJ north america . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the third hour , there should be NUM bacteria in the NOUN , an increase of NUM organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the important concept of ADJ growth is that the population growth rate — the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation — is VERB ; that is , it is increasing at a greater and greater rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after NUM day and NUM of these cycles , the population would have increased from NUM to more than NUM NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the value “ r ” can be positive , meaning the population is increasing in size ; or negative , meaning the population is VERB in size ; or NUM , where the population ’s size is ADJ , a condition known as NUM population growth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a further NOUN of the formula VERB that different species have ADJ differences in their ADJ rate of increase ( often thought of as the potential for reproduction ) , even under ideal conditions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> age structure is the NOUN of a population at different age NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> age structure allows better NOUN of population growth , plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows a variety of ADV - VERB NOUN with similar NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN / PROPN NOUN , a ADJ NOUN VERB a less dangerous NUM , such as the ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB the non - ADJ NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of NOUN is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous NUM types . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN relationship occurs when NUM species benefits from the close , ADJ interaction , while the other neither benefits nor is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> birds VERB in trees provide an example of a NOUN relationship ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and VERB nutrients from it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this relationship , the NOUN benefits , but the organism being VERB upon , the host is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the host is usually VERB by the NOUN as it VERB resources the host would normally use to maintain itself . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other factors influence species NOUN as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the study of island NOUN attempts to explain the relatively high species NOUN found in certain VERB island NOUN , including the PROPN PROPN that VERB the young PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> relative species NOUN is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a NOUN , ecosystem , or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> community dynamics are the changes in community structure and NOUN over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and climate change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eventually , over NUM years , the NOUN will reach its equilibrium point where species NOUN is no longer changing and VERB the community before the fire . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this equilibrium state is referred to as the NOUN community , which will remain stable until the next disturbance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new . <sent_end> <sent_begin> animal behavior has been studied for decades , by NOUN in the science of NOUN , by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology , and by scientists of many NOUN in the study of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although there is VERB between these NOUN , scientists in these behavioral fields take different NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another activity or movement of innate behavior is NOUN , or the ADJ movement in response to a stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the increased or VERB speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the long - range ADJ movement of animals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is an evolved , VERB response to variation in resource NOUN , and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN are a series of ADJ visual behaviors ( signals ) designed to attract and VERB a member of the opposite sex to mate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are ADJ in the animal NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , it is of NOUN benefit for the worker to maintain the NOUN without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of individual NOUN to VERB the reproductive NOUN of a relative and thus NUM ’s ADJ NOUN VERB through PROPN selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this phenomenon can explain many ADV ADJ behaviors seen in animals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ mating refers to NUM male mating with multiple females . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in these situations , the female must be responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species involved . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN recognize the first adult they see , their mother , and make a bond with her . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN conditioning , the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal VERB to the stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a major NOUN of such conditioning was psychologist PROPN skinner , the NOUN of the skinner NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , some animals must VERB energy VERB for their offspring . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , all species have an energy budget : they must balance energy NOUN with their use of energy for metabolism , reproduction , parental care , and energy storage ( such as NOUN building up body fat for NOUN NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> parental care and NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN describes species that reproduce ADV during their lives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some animals are able to mate only once per year , but survive multiple mating NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> k - selected species are species selected by stable , predictable environments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> populations of k - selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity ( hence the term k - selected ) where ADJ competition is high . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in NOUN of disturbances is called resistance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the speed at which an ecosystem VERB equilibrium after being VERB , called its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ecosystem resistance and NOUN are especially important when VERB human impact . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in many ecosystems , the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms ( plants and / or NOUN ) , which are called primary producers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the organisms that consume the primary producers are NOUN : the primary consumers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> secondary consumers are usually NOUN that eat the primary consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ consumers are NOUN that eat other NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> higher - level consumers VERB on the next lower NOUN levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the ADJ consumers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when you are ADJ to create a NOUN , in the upper - right NOUN of the PROPN PROPN PROPN , VERB open NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM general types of food NOUN are often shown VERB within a single ecosystem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a VERB food web ( such as the lake PROPN food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by NOUN and various NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ food web consists of a base of organisms that VERB on VERB organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ ecosystem model attempts to VERB the NOUN , interaction , and dynamics of entire ecosystems ; it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a food web is an example of a ADJ ecosystem model . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ and NOUN models , in contrast , are ADJ methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of VERB the effects of potential environmental changes without direct NOUN , although with some NOUN as to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple ADJ NOUN to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer NOUN to ADV model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> productivity within PROPN levels <sent_end> <sent_begin> productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem VERB into NOUN in a particular ADJ level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the total mass , in a unit area at the time of measurement , of living or previously living organisms within a ADJ level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ecosystems have characteristic amounts of NOUN at each ADJ level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another main NOUN that is important in VERB energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> net production efficiency ( PROPN ) allows NOUN to VERB how ADV organisms of a particular ADJ level VERB the energy they receive into NOUN ; it is calculated using the following formula : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the structure of ecosystems can be VERB with ADJ NOUN , which were first described by the ADJ studies of charles PROPN in the NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN show the relative amounts of various NOUN ( such as number of organisms , energy , and NOUN ) across ADJ levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> water contains hydrogen and oxygen , which is essential to all living processes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is the area of the earth where water movement and storage occurs : as liquid water on the surface and ADP the surface or VERB ( NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , polar NOUN NOUN , and NOUN ) , and as water vapor in the atmosphere . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important NOUN of fossil NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land ADP the surface of the ocean ) by the NOUN of NOUN and other ADJ systems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbon NOUN from the ocean floor are taken deep within the earth by the process of NOUN : the movement of NUM ADJ NOUN ADP another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a NOUN VERB or from ADJ NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> atmospheric NOUN is found in the form of NOUN dioxide ( PROPN ) , and as NOUN falls through the atmosphere , NOUN is VERB in the form of weak ADJ acid ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also , the NOUN of NOUN - containing NOUN releases NOUN into the soil . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN studying NOUN in the 1980s discovered NOUN of PROPN species representing a variety of NOUN to particular NOUN types and specific NOUN strategies : eating NOUN VERB in the water , NOUN and then eating algae from NOUN , eating NOUN NOUN from the bottom , and eating the eggs of other species of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of lake PROPN are the product of an adaptive radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an adaptive radiation is a rapid ( less than NUM NUM years in the case of the lake PROPN NOUN ) VERB through NOUN of a ADJ tree into many closely related species ; typically , the species “ VERB ” into different NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many genes code for proteins , which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms ADJ and VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells , both the proteins as well as the products and NOUN of metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of NOUN , so it provides NUM way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is not entirely clear how greater energy input could VERB into more species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of ADJ ecosystems may promote NOUN by increasing the NOUN , or number of ADJ NOUN , in the NOUN relative to higher NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the greater NOUN provides more opportunities for NOUN , NOUN , and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of extinction rates are VERB by the fact that most NOUN are probably VERB without observation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the extinction of a NOUN or NOUN is likely to be VERB by humans , especially if it has been VERB or used in some other way . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN are VERB as a common ( shared ) resource even when the NOUN territory VERB within a country ’s ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the NOUN of the NOUN in which essentially no PROPN has a NOUN to exercise NOUN in VERB a NOUN when it is not owned by that PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the natural outcome of NOUN of resources held in common is their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it now appears that the global decline in ADJ species recognized in the NUM is , in some part , caused by the NOUN PROPN NOUN , which causes the disease PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is evidence that the NOUN is native to africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used NOUN and ADJ species : the african VERB NOUN ( PROPN NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in march NUM , a group of NOUN VERB together in a fish market in PROPN for a ADJ performance of PROPN 's “ PROPN to NOUN ” from his ADJ PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while NOUN were building over PROPN 's efforts to join the european union , and even as ADJ troops had taken control of the ADJ NOUN in PROPN , the PROPN PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN tried to VERB the ADJ times for NOUN with music and NOUN . ADJ NOUN like this are called NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they often are VERB on NOUN and shared on the internet ; frequently they go viral . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) identified NUM types of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really VERB , such as people standing in line at the post office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are those who come together for a ADJ event that occurs regularly , like a religious service . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they VERB the importance of these norms in VERB NOUN behavior , especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN theory VERB that , in this NOUN , people VERB and respond to the NOUN situation with their particular ( individual ) set of norms , which may change as the NOUN experience VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this focus on the individual component of interaction VERB a symbolic NOUN perspective . for PROPN and PROPN , the process begins when individuals ADV find themselves in a new situation , or when an existing situation ADV becomes ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social movements are ADJ , organized groups that VERB to work toward a common social goal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while most of us learned about social movements in history classes , we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused — and we may be completely ADJ with the NOUN toward global social movements . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> examples include ADJ groups , NOUN against ADJ driving ( PROPN ) , the PROPN movement for immigration reform , and the human rights campaign ’s NOUN for marriage equality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these include the 1960s NOUN movement , including the revolutionary group the PROPN PROPN , as well as ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and their NOUN VERB the NOUN , and the protest organization in PROPN was formed as well as the PROPN PROPN and the PROPN from ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a social movement industry , which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are VERB toward similar goals , was growing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> martin PROPN king PROPN emerged during these events to become the ADJ leader of the movement , gained respect from NOUN in the federal government , and VERB by even more VERB NOUN such as the student non - violent PROPN committee ( PROPN ) , the congress of racial equality ( core ) , the national association for the PROPN of colored people ( PROPN ) , and the southern christian leadership PROPN ( PROPN ) , among others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> several still exist today . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you can see , there may be many competing ADJ NOUN even within social movements VERB to similar diagnostic NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , ADJ NOUN is the call to action : what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the ADJ frame ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are action - oriented . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> collective behavior and social movements are just NUM of the forces driving social change , which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> essentially , any ADJ shift in the status NOUN , be it ADJ or random , human - caused or natural , can lead to social change . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with NUM another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term culture refers to the group ’s shared practices , values , and beliefs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> culture VERB a group ’s way of life , from ADJ , everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members ' lives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some sociologists study social facts , which are the laws , NOUN , values , religious beliefs , customs , NOUN , NOUN , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life , that may contribute to these changes in the family . <sent_end> <sent_begin> do people in the united states view marriage and family differently than before ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he argued that how an individual comes to view PRON or PRON is based to a very large extent on interactions with others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN called specific individuals that VERB a person ’s life significant others , and he also VERB “ VERB others ” as the organized and ADJ NOUN of a social group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s work is closely associated with the symbolic NOUN approach and VERB the NOUN - level of analysis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the different NOUN to research based on NOUN or NOUN are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between ADJ sociology and ADJ sociology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ sociology uses statistical methods such as NOUN with large numbers of participants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> researchers VERB data using statistical techniques to see if they can VERB patterns of human behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , although NOUN is generally considered an individual phenomenon , PROPN durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his studied social NOUN within a group , or social NOUN , and VERB that differences in NOUN rates might be explained by religion - based differences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> durkheim VERB a large amount of data about PROPN who had ended their lives , and he did indeed find differences based on religion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , also called structural - functional theory , VERB society as a structure with ADJ parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN grew out of the NOUN of english NOUN and NOUN , PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) , who saw NOUN between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN - brown ( NUM ) defined the function of any ADJ activity as the part it VERB in social life as a whole , and therefore the NOUN it makes to social stability and NOUN ( PROPN - brown NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called ADJ equilibrium by later sociologists such as PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ functions can be beneficial , neutral , or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social processes that have ADJ consequences for the operation of society are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in education , examples of NOUN include getting bad NOUN , NOUN , VERB out , not VERB , and not finding ADJ employment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , while a conflict NOUN studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic NOUN would be more interested in how individuals in the VERB group interact , as well as the NOUN and NOUN NOUN use to communicate their message . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the focus on the importance of NOUN in building a society led sociologists like PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) to develop a technique called PROPN analysis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN used NOUN as an NOUN for social interaction and recognized that people ’s interactions VERB patterns of cultural “ NOUN . ” because it can be ADJ what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to VERB his or her role as the situation VERB ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> studies that use the symbolic NOUN perspective are more likely to use ADJ research methods , such as in - depth NOUN or NOUN observation , because they seek to understand the symbolic NOUN in which research subjects live . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full NOUN , but research does n’t support this opinion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> researchers PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) conducted a ADJ - analysis of research on the full NOUN ’s effects on behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN - analysis is a technique in which the results of ADV all previous studies on a specific subject are VERB together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this field , results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before — knowledge of other cultures , knowledge of NOUN and beliefs , or knowledge of NOUN and attitudes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> no matter what research approach they use , researchers want to VERB the study ’s NOUN , which refers to how likely research results are to be VERB if the study is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN increases the NOUN that what happens to NUM person will happen to all people in a group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the next step researchers VERB is to conduct NOUN research through a NOUN review , which is a review of any existing similar or related studies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN to the NOUN and a ADJ ADJ search will VERB existing research about the topic of study . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in research , independent variables are the cause of the change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the dependent variable is the effect , or NOUN that is changed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> researchers choose methods that best VERB their study topics and that fit with their overall NOUN to research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in VERB studies ' NOUN , sociologists generally choose from NUM widely used methods of social NOUN : survey , field research , experiment , and secondary data analysis , or use of existing sources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> every research method comes with NOUN and NOUN , and the topic of study strongly VERB which method or methods are put to use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a survey VERB a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college NOUN , international students , or NOUN living with type NUM ( ADJ - NOUN ) NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most researchers choose to survey a small NOUN of the population , or a sample : that is , a ADJ number of subjects who represent a larger population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people are more likely to share ADJ NOUN if they can respond to questions ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of information is ADJ data — results that are ADJ and often based on what is seen in a natural setting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ information is ADJ to organize and VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> much of the data VERB in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and while field research looks for correlation , its small sample size does not allow for VERB a ADJ relationship between NUM variables . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes a researcher VERB to study NUM specific person or event . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a case study is an in - depth analysis of a single event , situation , or individual . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to conduct a case study , a researcher VERB existing sources like documents and ADJ NOUN , VERB NOUN , VERB in direct observation and even NOUN observation , if possible . researchers might use this method to study a single case of , for example , a ADJ child , drug PROPN , cancer patient , criminal , or NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the NOUN of secondary data is that it is ADJ research ( or ADJ research ) , meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people ’s behaviors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike studies requiring direct contact with people , using previously published data does n’t require entering a population and the investment and NOUN ADJ in that research process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values , he declared it was entirely ADJ to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists , he stated , must establish value NOUN , a practice of remaining ADJ , without bias or NOUN , during the course of a study and in NOUN results ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists are VERB to VERB research NOUN without VERB or VERB significant data . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ culture , in contrast , consists of the ideas , attitudes , and beliefs of a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> material and ADJ aspects of culture are linked , and physical objects often VERB cultural ideas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first , and perhaps most crucial , elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> values are a culture ’s standard for VERB what is good and just in society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> values are deeply embedded and critical for VERB and VERB a culture ’s beliefs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> values VERB an ideal culture , the standards society would like to VERB and live up to . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but ideal culture VERB from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an ideal culture , there would be no NOUN NOUN , NOUN , poverty , or racial tension . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these examples describe the visible and ADJ rules of conduct through which societies are VERB , or what sociologists call norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> norms define how to behave in NOUN with what a society has defined as good , right , and important , and most members of the society VERB to them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB experiments VERB and explore the many ADJ social rules we live by . norms may be further classified as either NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( PROPN - NOUN ) are norms that VERB the moral views and principles of a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB them can have ADJ consequences . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while different cultures have varying systems of NOUN , NUM NOUN is common to all : language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN contain a system of NOUN used for written communication , while others rely on only VERB communication and ADJ actions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in ADJ society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> popular culture events might include a NOUN , a NOUN NOUN , or the NOUN NOUN of a television show . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an innovation refers to an object or concept ’s initial appearance in society — it ’s ADJ because it is ADV new . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM ways to come across an ADJ object or idea : VERB it or VERB it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> material culture tends to VERB more quickly than ADJ culture ; technology can spread through society in a matter of months , but it can take NOUN for the ideas and beliefs of society to change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologist william f. PROPN VERB the term culture VERB to refer to this time that VERB between the NOUN of a new NOUN of material culture and its NOUN as part of ADJ culture ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> culture NOUN can also cause ADJ problems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> exactly what is a society ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> in sociological terms , society refers to a group of people who live in a ADJ community and share the same culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on a broader scale , society consists of the people and institutions around us , our shared beliefs , and our cultural ideas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> previously , the NOUN of a region ’s NOUN or water supply forced ADJ societies to VERB in search of food sources for their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ societies formed in areas where NOUN and other conditions allowed them to grow stable NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they were similar to NOUN - NOUN in that they largely VERB on the environment for survival , but since they did n’t have to VERB their location to follow resources , they were able to start permanent NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN societies , sometimes known as ADJ or ADJ societies , are a recent development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike industrial societies that are VERB in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in his NOUN to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ if i do not VERB to the NOUN of society , if in DET NOUN i do not VERB to the customs observed in DET country and in DET class , the NOUN i VERB , the social NOUN in which i AUX VERB , produce , although in an ADJ form , the same effects as punishment ” ( durkheim NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> durkheim also believed that social integration , or the strength of NOUN that people have to their social groups , was a key factor in social life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> following the ideas of PROPN and PROPN , durkheim VERB society to a living organism , in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even the ADV ADJ members of society are necessary , durkheim argued , as NOUN for deviance VERB established cultural values and norms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> laws exist as VERB NOUN and are based on NOUN rather than NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the NOUN from mechanical to organic NOUN is , in the long run , ADJ for a society , durkheim noted that it can be a time of NOUN and “ PROPN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the outcomes of the NOUN is something he called social NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN — literally , “ without law ” — is a situation in which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> marx described modern society in terms of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the condition in which the individual is VERB and VERB from his or her society , work , or the sense of self . <sent_end> <sent_begin> marx defined NUM specific types of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s analysis of modern society VERB on the concept of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a rational society is NUM built around NOUN and efficiency rather than NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a sense , it exists by NOUN , both prior and current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is an example of the process of NOUN , the act of VERB a convention or NOUN into society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bear in mind that the institution , while ADV VERB , is still quite real . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> roles and PROPN you can imagine , people VERB many types of behaviors in day - to - day life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person ’s social status . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , while reading this NOUN , you are VERB the role of a student . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN are VERB — those you do not select , such as NOUN , elderly person , or female . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others , called achieved NOUN , are obtained by choice , such as a high school NOUN , self - made NOUN , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a daughter or NOUN , you VERB a different status than as a NOUN or employee . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> consider the NOUN of a parent : NOUN , NOUN , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral NOUN — the list goes on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , a person can experience role conflict when NUM or more roles are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a parent who also has a full - time NOUN can experience role conflict on a daily basis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the NUM , as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation NOUN VERB , suburbs developed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> suburbs are the communities surrounding cities , typically close enough for a daily NOUN in , but far enough away to allow for more space than city living VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ ADJ NOUN of the early twentieth century has largely VERB due to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> together , the suburbs , NOUN , and ADJ areas all combine to form a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new york was the first u.s. NOUN , a huge urban NOUN VERB multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the u.s. NOUN . the ADJ NOUN in PROPN means long NOUN and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the world ’s most ADV ADJ cities are now largely concentrated in the global south , a marked change from several decades ago when the ADJ cities were found in the global north . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the next NUM years , the ADJ global challenge for ADJ populations , particularly in less developed countries , will be to achieve development that occurs without VERB or VERB the natural environment , also called ADJ development ( united nations , department of economic and social affairs , population division NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this field is closely related to human NOUN , which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> and it is far more ADJ than even the NOUN of broken NOUN and ADJ NOUN that NOUN the environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> e - waste is the name for ADJ , broken , and VERB - out NOUN — from NOUN to ADJ NOUN to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the challenge is that these products , which are VERB at ADJ rates NOUN in part to VERB NOUN ( the NOUN of products to quickly become ADJ and then be replaced by the constant NOUN of ADJ and ADJ NOUN ) , have ADJ chemicals and ADJ NOUN in them , which makes for a dangerous combination . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> without ADJ interaction — the holding , VERB , VERB , the NOUN and NOUN given to most young children — she had not learned to VERB or to VERB , to eat or to interact , to play or even to understand the world around her . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from a sociological point of view , PROPN had not been VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> socialization is the process through which people are VERB to be ADJ members of a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to VERB society ’s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists measure NOUN using the ADJ NOUN ( the number of live NOUN per NUM people per year ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just as NOUN measures NOUN , the NOUN rate is a measure of the number of people who die . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ death rate is a number derived from the number of NOUN per NUM people per year . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> moral development is an important part of the socialization process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a ADV functioning society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , another word for ADJ NOUN , is a method used to VERB gas and oil from NOUN by VERB down into the earth and VERB a high - pressure mixture of water , NOUN , and ADJ chemicals into the rock . <sent_end> <sent_begin> commonly , this process also includes NOUN ADV into the rock to create new NOUN for gas to travel . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a NOUN NOUN , new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process is sometimes ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another example of a NOUN is people who share similar characteristics but are not VERB to NUM another in any way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these people are considered a category , and as an example all children born from approximately NUM are referred to as “ PROPN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> why are PROPN a category and not a group ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> because while some of them may share a sense of identity , they do not , as a whole , interact frequently with each other . ADV , people within an aggregate or category can become a group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they may also be task - focused and time - limited . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these groups serve an instrumental function rather than an ADJ one , meaning that their role is more ADJ or task - oriented than emotional . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN or office can be an example of a secondary group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a small group is typically NUM where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share ADJ interaction , such as a nuclear family , a NOUN , or a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) wrote ADV about the difference between a NOUN , or NUM - member group , and a NOUN , which is a NUM - member group ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the former , if NUM person VERB , the group can no longer exist . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a further risk is that group members might VERB sides and VERB themselves into VERB NOUN rather than reaching a solution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , a X - NOUN leader ( french for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands - off , allowing group members to self - VERB and make their own decisions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of this kind of leader might be an art NOUN who VERB the art NOUN , leaves materials on the NOUN , and VERB students to help themselves and make some art . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN society and a NOUN NOUN are examples of ADJ organizations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ organizations are groups that we must be VERB , or pushed , to join . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these may include prison or a NOUN center . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people often VERB about NOUN PUNCT VERB them slow , rule - bound , difficult to VERB , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let ’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . NOUN of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places NUM individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , as an employee at PROPN , your shift NOUN VERB you tasks . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , NOUN are also characterized by NOUN , which takes personal feelings out of ADJ situations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a NOUN to protect organizations from NOUN , NOUN NOUN , and other types of NOUN , simultaneously protecting NOUN and others served by the organization . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN of society ( PROPN NUM ) refers to the increasing presence of the ADJ food business model in common social institutions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , NOUN , NOUN , and control ( NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> think of social order as an employee NOUN and social control as a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN at work is a positive NOUN for working hard . <sent_end> <sent_begin> negative sanctions are NOUN for VERB norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> being arrested is a punishment for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologist robert PROPN agreed that deviance is an ADJ part of a functioning society , but he expanded on durkheim ’s ideas by developing NOUN theory , which VERB that access to ADV acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person VERB or VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from birth , we VERB encouraged to achieve the “ american PROPN ” of financial success . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike NOUN , conflict theorists do n’t see these factors as positive functions of society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those who do , however , have often been labeled “ ADJ ” by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB theory VERB the NOUN of a ADJ behavior to another person by members of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , what is considered ADJ is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who VERB them , but by the reactions of others to these behaviors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if you use a NOUN to break into a car , you are VERB a ADJ crime ; if you VERB someone with the NOUN , you are VERB a violent crime . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or NOUN committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an often VERB category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - NOUN workers in a business environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both NOUN were VERB , VERB , and forced to VERB one another with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when VERB by police , the NOUN of the crime explained that the NOUN were gay and “ VERB like [ they ] VERB it ” ( wilson and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> attacks based on a person ’s race , religion , or other characteristics are known as hate crimes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> hate crimes in the united states evolved from the time of early european NOUN and their violence toward native americans . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> police are a civil force in charge of VERB laws and public order at a federal , state , or community level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> no ADJ national police force exists in the united states , although there are federal law enforcement officers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is easy to look at the ADJ ADJ PROPN product and think technology is a recent addition to our world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but from the NOUN NOUN to the most ADJ - NOUN ADJ NOUN tools , technology has described the application of science to address the problems of daily life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we might look back at the ADJ and ADJ NOUN of the 1970s that had about as much storage as an PROPN PROPN and VERB our eyes in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> numerous facts NOUN available through the government , NOUN , and the private NOUN NOUN common safety measures , including the following : become familiar with privacy rights ; read privacy policies when making a purchase ( rather than simply VERB “ VERB ” ) ; give out only the minimum information VERB by any source ; VERB why information is being collected , how it is going to be used , and who will have access it ; and VERB your credit history for red NOUN that indicate your identity has been VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> net NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> the issue of net NOUN , the principle that all internet data should be treated equally by internet service NOUN , is part of the national debate about internet access and the ADJ divide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on NUM side of this debate is the belief that those who provide internet service , like those who provide NOUN and water , should be treated as common NOUN , legally prohibited from VERB based on the NOUN or nature of the goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system , as with most other social problems , are VERB in ADJ society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to conflict theorists , NOUN and the NOUN of profit lead to the NOUN of health : the changing of something not generally thought of as a NOUN into something that can be bought and sold in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this view , people with money and power — the dominant group — are the ones who make decisions about how the healthcare system will be run . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> healthcare u.s. <sent_end> <sent_begin> healthcare coverage can ADV be divided into NUM main categories : public healthcare ( government - funded ) and private healthcare ( ADV funded ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM main ADV funded healthcare programs are medicare , which provides health services to people over NUM - NUM years old as well as people who meet other standards for NOUN , and medicaid , which provides services to people with very low NOUN who meet other NOUN requirements . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM NOUN of the patient protection and affordable care act is that it will create a system of VERB NOUN , a term that for many people in the united states has negative NOUN VERB from the cold war era and earlier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under a VERB NOUN system , the government VERB and runs the system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB the NOUN , NOUN , and other NOUN , and it VERB and runs the NOUN ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN between black and white americans shows the gap clearly ; in NUM , the average life NOUN for white males was approximately NUM years longer than for black males : NUM compared to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an even stronger NOUN was found in NUM : the NOUN NOUN , which is the number of NOUN in a given time or place , rate for blacks was nearly DET that of whites at NUM compared to NUM per NUM live NOUN ( u.s. PROPN bureau NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to a report from the henry PROPN PROPN foundation ( NUM ) , african americans also have higher NOUN of several other diseases and causes of NOUN , from cancer to heart disease to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the post - ADJ united states , those of us who have never experienced such a NOUN take for granted the rights our society guarantees for each citizen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we do not think about the relatively recent nature of the protections , unless , of course , we know someone ADV VERB by the lack of NOUN or NOUN of ADV VERB a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mental PROPN with mental disorders ( a condition that makes it more difficult to VERB with everyday life ) and people with mental illness ( a severe , VERB mental disorder that requires long - term treatment ) experience a wide range of effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the national institute of mental health ( PROPN ) , the most common mental disorders in the united states are anxiety disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> almost NUM percent of u.s. adults are likely to be affected in a single year , and NUM percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( national institute of mental health NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN refers to a reduction in one ’s ability to perform everyday tasks . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the world health organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe NOUN that ’s important to the sociological perspective . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even after slavery was VERB in NUM , the next NUM years of u.s. history saw ADJ racism and prejudice against black people . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an example of NOUN NOUN , the same NOUN that are VERB today at the ADJ and ADJ population ( ADJ , for instance ) , have been VERB at various racial and ADJ groups in earlier history . <sent_end> <sent_begin> of course , no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public now , except when VERB about ADJ people . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward — even to hate — ADJ people ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , PROPN ( NUM ) suggests we might view illness as a NOUN that can push others to view the ADJ in an ADJ manner . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of illness often has the greatest effect on the patient and the kind of care he or she receives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many VERB that our society and even our healthcare institutions VERB against certain diseases — like mental disorders , PROPN , ADJ diseases , and skin disorders ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this regulatory body will patent NUM types of innovation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> utility NOUN are the first type . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are granted for the NOUN or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant NOUN to existing NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) suggest an evolutionary model of technological change , in which a NOUN in NUM form of technology leads to a number of variations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once those are VERB , a NOUN VERB , and then a period of ADJ NOUN to the technology , VERB by a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this section , we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the names suggest , media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross - cultural exchange of ideas , while technological globalization refers to the cross - cultural development and exchange of technology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> technological globalization is VERB in large part by technological diffusion , the spread of technology across NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the last NUM decades , there has been rapid NOUN in the spread of technology to peripheral and semi - peripheral nations , and a NUM world bank report VERB both the benefits and ADJ challenges of this diffusion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social scientists take the idea of the NOUN society so ADV that there is an entire journal VERB to its study , PROPN and society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN VERB by PROPN PROPN , VERB in the form of an all - powerful , all - VERB government by george PROPN in NUM , and later VERB by PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) is increasingly VERB in the form of technology used to VERB our every move . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN was VERB as a form of constant NOUN in which the observation NOUN are ADJ and the observed is never VERB with directly . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN - PROPN are people who see technology as VERB the NOUN and NOUN of modern life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but for NOUN , technology VERB the potential for a ADJ future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for those VERB an ADJ middle ground , technology might VERB status ( in the form of a massive flat - NOUN television ) or failure ( ownership of a basic old ADJ NOUN with no NOUN or NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social construction of reality <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while we VERB the technology NOUN of PROPN ’s space projects , we should also VERB that those benefits are not shared equally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists like PROPN PROPN , a NOUN at george PROPN university , are VERB more and more evidence of a VERB gap between those who have access to rapidly VERB technology , and those who do not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN NOUN of the recent book , average is over : VERB america beyond the age of the great PROPN , this inequality in access to technology and information is going to VERB the inequality in skills , and ultimately , in wages and global standards of living . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that VERB the income needed for a basic standard of living . <sent_end> <sent_begin> income inequality VERB the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , VERB the share of income received by the top NUM % to the share of income received by the bottom NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after all , according to the federal register , the ADJ household income for a family of NUM was $ NUM in new jersey and $ NUM in PROPN in NUM , and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the poverty line is based on cash income , which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non - cash form , like medicaid ( health care for low - income individuals and families ) and food aid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also , low - income families can VERB for federal housing assistance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the other extreme of the budget constraint line , an individual would work NUM hours , earn NUM income , but VERB NUM hours of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at point a on the budget constraint line , by working NUM hours a week , NUM weeks a year , the utility - VERB choice is to work a total of NUM hours per year and earn $ NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> now VERB that a government NOUN program guarantees every family with a single mother and NUM children $ NUM in income . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from the great depression of the 1930s until NUM , the united states ’ most visible NOUN program was aid to families with dependent children ( PROPN ) , which provided cash payments to NOUN with children who were below the poverty line . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this program was often just called “ welfare . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , congress passed and president bill clinton signed into law the personal responsibility and work opportunity PROPN act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” the new law replaced PROPN with ADJ assistance for PROPN families ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates that the earned income tax NOUN , child tax NOUN , and the PROPN program all cost the federal government money — either in direct NOUN or in loss of tax NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB for the government tax cuts for the child tax credit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> real federal spending on PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , NUM - NUM increased from more than $ NUM NUM in NUM to over an estimated $ NUM NUM by NUM , far VERB estimated NUM NOUN in the PROPN ( child tax NOUN ) and PROPN of over $ NUM NUM and $ NUM NUM , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( source : office of management and budget ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the safety net includes a number of other programs : government - VERB school NOUN and NOUN for children from low - income families ; the special PROPN food program for women , PROPN and children ( PROPN ) , which provides food assistance for ADJ women and NOUN ; the low income home energy assistance program , which provides help with home NOUN bills ; housing assistance , which helps pay the NOUN ; and PROPN security income , which provides cash support for the ADJ and the elderly poor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> income is a flow of money received , often measured on a ADJ or an annual basis ; wealth is the sum of the value of all assets , including money in bank accounts , financial investments , a NOUN fund , and the value of a home . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in VERB wealth all NOUN must be VERB , such as debt VERB on a home NOUN and on credit NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> data from household income tax returns in NUM shows that the top NUM % of households had an average income of $ NUM per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of NUM % . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the effective income tax , which is total taxes paid divided by total income ( all sources of income such as wages , profits , interest , ADJ income , and government NOUN such as NOUN ’ benefits ) , was much lower . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the effective tax paid by the top NUM % of NOUN was NUM % , while the bottom NUM NOUN actually paid negative effective income taxes , because of provisions like the earned income tax credit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this labor market situation VERB what a monopoly firm does in selling a product , but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the higher union wage PROPN , the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have VERB in equilibrium . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because over time unions were stronger in NOUN than in service industries , the growth in jobs was not VERB where the unions were . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is interesting to note that several of the ADJ unions in the country are made up of government workers , including the american PROPN of state , county and PROPN employees ( PROPN ) ; the service employees international union ; and the national education association . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the membership of each of these unions is listed in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the equal pay act of NUM said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the civil rights act of NUM VERB employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM ADJ effect , as just noted , is that immigration VERB toward low - NOUN workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low - NOUN workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a study by michael PROPN PROPN found that for each NUM % rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school NOUN in the labor market , high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by NUM % . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the effects on wages of low - NOUN workers are not large — perhaps in the range of decline of about NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many economic transactions are made in a situation of ADJ information , where either the buyer , the seller , or both , are less than NUM % certain about the NOUN of what is being bought and sold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also , the NOUN may be characterized by ADJ information , in which NUM party has more information than the other regarding the economic NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sellers may offer a NOUN , which is a promise to VERB or VERB the good , at least for a certain period of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller VERB to VERB PRON that goes ADJ for a set time period . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another approach is to require a NOUN on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally VERB to VERB some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet another approach is to require NOUN , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to VERB and sell if the loan is not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of the programs look much like private insurance , in the sense that the members of a group makes ADJ payments into a fund , and those in the group who VERB an ADJ experience receive payments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other programs protect against risk , but without an explicit fund being set up . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> deposit insurance : banks are required by law to pay a small NOUN of their deposits to the federal deposit insurance corporation , which goes into a fund that is used to pay NOUN the value of their bank deposits up to $ NUM ( the amount was raised from $ NUM to $ NUM in NUM ) if the bank should go ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN are ADJ than others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a risk group can be defined as a group that VERB roughly the same NOUN of an ADJ event occurring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , NOUN insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> health insurance policies often have a NOUN , in which the NOUN must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ NUM for each NOUN NOUN , and the insurance company would cover the rest . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another method of cost - NOUN is NOUN , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has VERB to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a health maintenance organization ( PROPN ) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person VERB in the plan — regardless of how many services are provided . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care , but the healthcare NOUN , which is receiving only a fixed payment , has an incentive to reduce the moral NOUN problem by limiting the quantity of care provided — as long as it will not lead to ADJ health problems and higher costs later . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the profit NOUN has since continued to increase each year , though at a less ADJ or consistent rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( source : federal reserve economic data ( PROPN ) X ) NUM NOUN VERB corporate profits after tax were around $ NUM NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size , but that have potential to grow substantially . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these firms VERB money from a variety of individual or institutional investors , including banks , institutions like college NOUN , insurance companies that hold financial reserves , and corporate NOUN funds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a corporation is a business that “ VERB ” — that is owned by NOUN that have limited NOUN for the debt of the company but share in its profits ( and losses ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> corporations may be private or public , and may or may not have stock that is ADV VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who VERB NUM % of a company ’s stock , by definition , VERB the entire company . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the stock of a company is divided into NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> corporate NOUN like PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , general electric , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN all have millions of NOUN of stock . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , a financial NOUN might buy a share of stock in PROPN - PROPN for $ NUM and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ NUM , for a gain of $ NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the increase in the value of the stock ( or of any NOUN ) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a larger law firm may be owned ADV by its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most private companies are relatively small , but there are some large private corporations , with NOUN of NOUN of dollars in annual sales , that do not have ADV issued stock , such as NOUN products NOUN PROPN , the PROPN NOUN company , and the PROPN NOUN and construction firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a firm VERB to sell stock , which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors , it is called a public company . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN own a public company . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the NOUN , either in future interest payments , capital gains , or increased NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a NOUN of deposit ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a NOUN , as it is commonly called , you agree to deposit a certain amount of money , often measured in thousands of dollars , in the account for a stated period of time , typically VERB from a few months to several years . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a bond is ADV an “ i VERB you ” note that is given to an NOUN in exchange for capital ( money ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bond has a face value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the amount the borrower VERB to pay the NOUN at NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the bond has a NOUN date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and NOUN date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to VERB a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this may or may not be the same as the face value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN in the stock market is generally up over time , but with some large NOUN along the way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows the path of the standard & poor ’s NUM index ( which is measured on the left - hand vertical axis ) and the PROPN PROPN index ( which is measured on the right - hand vertical axis ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> broad measures of the stock market , like the ones listed here , tend to move together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the other end of the spectrum , a ADJ fund might be quite broad ; at the extreme , some ADJ funds own a ADJ share of every firm in the stock market , and thus the value of the ADJ fund will VERB with the average of the overall stock market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ fund that VERB only to VERB the overall performance of the market is called an index fund . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> simple interest is an interest rate NOUN only on the ADJ amount . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a rational voter will recognize that NUM vote is extremely ADJ to make a difference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this theory of rational NOUN holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming ADJ and voting are too high , or they feel their vote will not be ADJ in the election . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a NUM work , an economic theory of democracy , the economist PROPN PROPN stated the problem this way : “ it seems ADJ that for a great many citizens in a democracy , rational behavior VERB any investment DET in political information per X . <sent_end> <sent_begin> no matter how significant a difference between parties is VERB to the rational citizen by his free information , or how ADJ he is about which party to support , he VERB that his vote has almost no chance of VERB the outcome PUNCT he will not even VERB all the free information available , since VERB it takes time . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> in his ADJ NUM NOUN PROPN two , the psychologist b. f. skinner VERB the issue even more ADV via NUM of his NOUN , who states : “ the chance that NUM man ’s vote will decide the issue in a national election PUNCT is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following clear it up feature VERB another aspect of the election process : spending . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( see the NOUN bring it home feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ) special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation , but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a special interest group can pressure legislators to VERB public policies that do not benefit society as a whole . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the early NOUN , about NUM NUM people in the united states were eligible for medicare , a government program that provides health insurance for those NUM and older . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on some issues , the elderly are a powerful interest group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the NOUN over passage of the NUM affordable care act ( PROPN ) , which became known as “ PROPN , ” there was ADJ lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and NOUN companies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , a lobby group , health care for america now ( PROPN ) , was VERB by labor unions and community groups and was organized to VERB corporate lobbying . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , spending $ NUM NUM dollars , was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a NOUN that all individuals will obtain health insurance by NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN organization , called citizens against government waste , produces an annual report , the PROPN book that attempts to VERB the amount of NOUN - NOUN spending , focusing on items that were VERB by only NUM member of congress , that were passed into law without any public NOUN , or that serve only a local purpose . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whether any specific NOUN VERB as NOUN can be controversial , of course , but at least by this measure , NOUN - NOUN spending VERB $ NUM NUM in NUM - NOUN spending can be encouraged by NOUN , an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a NOUN of otherwise ADJ laws that they ADV favor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if NUM member of the u.s. congress suggests building a new NOUN or NOUN in his or her own congressional district , the other members might VERB it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this case goes against the theory of the “ ADJ ” voter in a democracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ voter theory VERB that politicians will try to VERB policies to what VERB the ADJ voter NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right , the ADJ voter is in the middle of the spectrum . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NUM NOUN ADV lead to simple or obvious political NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the famous british economist PROPN PROPN wrote some decades ago : “ [ e ] ADJ theory , in itself , VERB no NOUN and can not establish any ADV ADJ laws . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a method of VERB ideas and VERB questions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ” the study of economics is neither ADV conservative , nor moderate , nor liberal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how large is the u.s. economy ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the size of a nation ’s overall economy is typically measured by its ADJ domestic product ( gdp ) , which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the measurement of gdp involves VERB up the production of millions of different goods and services — ADJ NOUN , cars , music NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , college NOUN , and all other new goods and services produced in the current year — and VERB them into a total dollar value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if PROPN VERB a new store , or PROPN VERB NOUN , these expenditures are counted under business investment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand , typically accounting for only about NUM % of gdp , but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , it VERB more ADV than consumption . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since the early 1980s , imports have typically VERB exports , and so the united states has experienced a trade deficit in most years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are goods at the ADJ stage of production at the end of a year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN who calculate gdp must avoid the NOUN of double NOUN , in which output is counted more than once as it VERB through the stages of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , imagine what would happen if government NOUN first counted the value of NOUN produced by a NOUN NOUN , and then counted the value of a new NOUN sold by an NOUN that contains those NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the ADJ NOUN of gdp is the ADJ national product ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gdp includes only what is produced within a country ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gdp NOUN is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we explore price NOUN in detail and how they are VERB in inflation , but this definition will do in the context of this chapter . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the generally upward long - term path of gdp has been regularly VERB by short - term NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a significant decline in real gdp is called a recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an especially ADJ and deep recession is called a depression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] VERB the pattern of NOUN and NOUN in the u.s. economy since NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the highest point of the economy , before the recession begins , is called the peak ; conversely , the lowest point of a recession , before a recovery begins , is called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , a recession VERB from peak to NOUN , and an economic NOUN runs from NOUN to peak . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to compare the gdp of countries with different NOUN , it is necessary to convert to a “ common NOUN ” using an exchange rate , which is the value of NUM currency in terms of another currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country a ’s currency that need to be VERB for a single unit of country b ’s currency ( for example , japanese NOUN per british NOUN ) , or as the NOUN ( for example , british NOUN per japanese NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let ’s begin with a brief NOUN of the ADJ patterns of economic growth around the world in the last NUM centuries , commonly referred to as the period of modern economic growth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key NOUN for economic progress . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economic growth in the last NUM centuries has made a ADJ change in the human condition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> richard PROPN , an economist at the university of southern california , wrote in NUM : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ production function describes the inputs and NOUN of a firm , or perhaps an industry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , the connection from inputs to NOUN for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like NOUN ( also called NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> again , greater physical capital implies more output . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to obtain a per capita production function , divide each input in [ link ] ( a ) by the population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this creates a second aggregate production function where the output is gdp per capita ( that is , gdp divided by population ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the inputs are the average level of human capital per person , the average level of physical capital per person , and the level of technology per person — see [ link ] ( b ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the european union has strong programs to VERB in scientific research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the researchers abraham PROPN and PROPN PROPN demonstrate that firms which received support from the ADJ government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales . <sent_end> <sent_begin> governments can support scientific research and ADJ NOUN that helps to create and spread new NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> high - income countries must ADV VERB new NOUN , whereas low - income countries can often find ways of VERB technology that has already been VERB and is well understood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the economist PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) gave this phenomenon a ADJ name : “ the NOUN of NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> of course , he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he was VERB out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for VERB up . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it also includes those who do want a job but have VERB looking , often due to being VERB by their inability to find ADJ employment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another important NOUN is the labor force participation rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are ADJ and looking for a job . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM reason is that the statistical agencies in many ADJ countries lack the resources and ADJ NOUN of the u.s. bureau of the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but a more difficult problem with international NOUN is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an NOUN who pays them regularly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , workers in these countries are VERB in short - term work , NOUN activities , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from the NOUN of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and ADJ labor markets , unemployment represents something of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the equilibrium wage ( we ) , the equilibrium quantity ( PROPN ) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists looking for reasons why wages might be ADJ ADV have focused on factors that may VERB most labor relationships in the economy , not just a few . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an NOUN VERB to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment NOUN at other firms , are the most likely to leave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the least ADJ workers , with fewer employment NOUN , are more likely to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> why are unemployment rates ADV higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another factor that VERB the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADV ADJ are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills VERB by the labor market , either because demand has VERB away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services , but wages and income levels , too . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second - to - last NOUN of [ link ] shows that the average ADJ wage for a VERB worker increased nearly NUM - ADJ from NUM to NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> step NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall NOUN of goods between the time periods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the general equation for percentage changes between NUM years , whether in the context of inflation or in any other NOUN , is : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most commonly VERB measure of inflation in the united states is the consumer price index ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is calculated by government NOUN at the u.s. bureau of labor statistics based on the prices in a fixed NOUN of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the new good is not included in the PROPN for some years , until its price is already lower , the PROPN may VERB VERB this price decline ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> taking these NOUN together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed NOUN of goods over time tends to VERB the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how NOUN in the quality of existing goods or the NOUN of new goods VERB the standard of living . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following clear it up feature is a must - read on how the PROPN is VERB and calculated . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it can be broken down into price NOUN for different industries , NOUN , and stages of processing ( like VERB goods , intermediate goods , ADJ materials for further processing , and so on ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is an international price index based on the prices of NOUN that is VERB or imported . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first NUM waves of inflation are easy to VERB in ADJ terms : they are right after world war i and world war ii . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , there are also NUM periods of severe negative inflation — called NOUN — in the early decades of the twentieth century : NUM following the deep recession of NUM and the other during the great depression of the 1930s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced , NOUN will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists usually VERB high inflation , but they VERB it in a ADJ way than many non - economists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> robert PROPN , NUM of NUM ’s PROPN PROPN NOUN in economics , carried out several NOUN during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of his questions VERB , “ do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national NOUN , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing NOUN in the quality of our schools ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN were on a scale of NUM , where NUM meant “ fully agree ” and NUM meant “ completely VERB . ” for the u.s. population as a whole , NUM % VERB “ fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national NOUN and just NUM % said “ completely VERB . ” however , among ADJ economists , only NUM % VERB “ fully agree , ” while the same percentage of NUM % VERB “ completely VERB . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the land of ADJ money <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted ADV and immediately with inflation , as in the land of PROPN money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , if other economic variables do not move exactly in NOUN with inflation , or if they VERB for inflation only after a time NOUN , then inflation can cause NUM types of problems : ADJ NOUN of purchasing power , VERB price signals , and NOUN in long - term NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM ADJ group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : NOUN who receive a private company NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most NOUN have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , NOUN are called “ defined benefits ” plans . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> high and variable inflation means that the NOUN in the economy to VERB in response to changes in prices are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> markets will VERB toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more ADV and ADV , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted ADV with inflation , it is said to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> loans often have built - in inflation NOUN , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by NUM percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by NUM percentage points as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ - rate NOUN ( NOUN ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> often , a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an NOUN , compared to a fixed - rate loan . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports VERB imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at some point , foreign investors become ADJ about the economy and move their money to other countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the economy then VERB into deep recession , with real gdp often falling up to NUM % or more in a single year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB to mexico in NUM when their gdp VERB NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> do not VERB the balance of trade ( which VERB imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , u.s. exports of services were equal to about NUM - half of u.s. exports of goods in NUM , compared to NUM - fifth in NUM third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by u.s. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money VERB into the united states ) and payments to foreign investors who had VERB their funds here ( money VERB out of the united states ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic NOUN as NOUN of cars or NOUN or oil : it is just trade that is VERB in the financial capital market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as economists see it , trade NOUN can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this NOUN we will VERB the ADJ connection between trade NOUN and flows of financial capital in NUM ways : a NOUN of trade between PROPN PROPN and PROPN , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> investment income VERB from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) VERB from the home country to the rest of the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the investment income ( bottom lines NUM and NUM ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines NUM and NUM ) are found in the financial account . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fundamental NOUN that total quantity of financial capital demanded VERB total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true . <sent_end> <sent_begin> domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when PROPN ’s economy was growing ADV in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade NOUN were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its ADJ economic health . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but from a NOUN of economic growth , PROPN ’s economy has been VERB in and out of recession since NUM , with real gdp growth VERB only about NUM % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been VERB higher . <sent_end> <sent_begin> clearly , a ADJ trade surplus is no NOUN of economic good health . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from NUM to NUM , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early NOUN , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the NOUN , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in NUM ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> why did the current account deficit rise so high , but then decline in NUM ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those economists who VERB the role of supply in the NOUN often refer to the work of a famous french economist of the early nineteenth century named PROPN - PROPN say ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> say ’s law is : “ supply creates its own demand . ” as a matter of ADJ NOUN , it seems clear that say never actually wrote down this law and that it VERB his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful NOUN for VERB a point of view . the NOUN behind say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it VERB income that is earned for someone : a worker , a NOUN , an NOUN , or those who are workers , NOUN , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , a recession is not a situation where all business NOUN are exactly VERB by an VERB number of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is VERB in size , business NOUN VERB the remaining success NOUN , and many firms end up VERB losses and VERB off workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> say ’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good NOUN for the long run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over periods of some years or decades , as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases , total demand in the economy VERB at roughly the same NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM major NOUN : a , b , c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant NOUN and will be the focus of the following discussion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with NOUN of different forms , NOUN are a much larger group of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN found in fruit — such as the red of NOUN ( NOUN ) , the yellow of NOUN seeds ( PROPN ) , or the NOUN of an ADJ NOUN ( β - NOUN ) — are used as NOUN to attract seed NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when studying a photosynthetic organism , scientists can determine the types of NOUN present by VERB NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN called a NOUN can VERB which NOUN of light a substance can absorb . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN measure transmitted light and VERB from it the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier PROPN for NOUN to the PROPN cycle where the electron is VERB onto carbon for long - term storage in the form of a NOUN . PROPN and PROPN are NUM major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain , which also includes the NOUN complex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN complex , an enzyme composed of NUM protein NOUN , VERB the electrons from the carrier molecule NOUN ( PROPN ) to the protein NOUN ( PROPN ) , thus VERB both the transfer of protons across the NOUN membrane and the transfer of electrons from NOUN to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these reactions actually have several names associated with them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another term , the PROPN cycle , is named for the man who discovered it , and because these reactions function as a cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others call it the PROPN - PROPN cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM kinds of communication in the world of living cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> communication between cells is called ADJ signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the NOUN : PROPN means " between " ( for example , VERB lines are those that cross each other ) and NOUN means " inside " ( like NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually ADJ or ADJ molecules called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN can thus be thought of as signaling molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN interact with proteins in target cells , which are cells that are affected by chemical signals ; these proteins are also called receptors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN and receptors exist in several NOUN ; however , a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> signals within the nerve cells are VERB by ADV - moving electrical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when these NOUN reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a NOUN of the next cell by the release of chemical NOUN called neurotransmitters by the ADJ cell ( the cell VERB the signal ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small NOUN between nerve cells , which are called chemical NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell ( the PROPN PROPN means self , a NOUN that the signaling cell VERB a signal to itself ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cell - surface receptors , also known as NOUN receptors , are cell surface , membrane - VERB ( integral ) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of receptor VERB the plasma membrane and VERB signal transduction , in which an extracellular signal is converted into an ADJ signal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> g - protein - linked receptors bind a ligand and VERB a membrane protein called a g - protein . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the activated g - protein then VERB with either an ion NOUN or an enzyme in the membrane ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN changes of the extracellular NOUN upon ligand binding can VERB through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to NOUN of the intracellular NOUN or its associated proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some cases , binding of the ligand causes NOUN of the receptor , which means that NUM receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a chemical compound formed when NUM molecules ( often identical ) join together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another VERB element is signal integration of the NOUN , in which signals from NUM or more different cell - surface receptors VERB to VERB the same response in the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell VERB to a specific response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the response to the increase in NOUN + varies , depending on the cell type involved . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in the β - cells of the pancreas , NOUN + signaling leads to the release of insulin , and in muscle cells , an increase in NOUN + leads to muscle NOUN . another second NOUN VERB in many different cell types is ADJ PROPN ( camp ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ PROPN is VERB by the enzyme ADP NOUN from atp ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the enzyme NOUN c VERB PROPN to form NOUN ( PROPN ) and NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these products of the NOUN of PROPN serve as second NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a cell is VERB , ADJ , or ADV dangerous to an organism , a cell can VERB a mechanism to VERB VERB cell death , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that VERB the release of ADV ADJ molecules from inside the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB NOUN ( [ link ] ) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that VERB NUM haploid cells ( cells with NUM - half the normal number of chromosomes ) VERB to form a diploid cell ( a cell with NUM sets of each chromosome , which is what normal body cells contain ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order to find another haploid NOUN cell that is VERB to mate , VERB NOUN secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when mating factor binds to cell - surface receptors in other NOUN cells that are ADV , they stop their normal growth cycles and VERB a cell signaling NOUN that includes protein NOUN and gtp - binding proteins that are similar to g - proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of life from NUM cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell cycle is an ADJ sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell ’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of NUM new daughter cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> human body cells have NUM chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have NUM chromosomes each . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a typical body cell , or ADJ cell , contains NUM VERB sets of chromosomes , a NOUN known as diploid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is VERB NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide NOUN called genes in exactly the same location , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> genes , the functional units of chromosomes , determine specific characteristics by VERB for specific proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dna VERB in the s phase of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after replication , the chromosomes are composed of NUM linked sister chromatids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when fully ADJ , the pairs of ADV VERB chromosomes are bound to each other by PROPN proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> throughout NOUN , nuclear dna remains in a semi - ADJ NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the s phase , dna replication can VERB through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of dna molecules — sister chromatids — that are ADV attached to the NOUN region . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is VERB during the s phase . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the PROPN phase , the cell VERB its energy stores and VERB proteins necessary for chromosome NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some cell organelles are VERB , and the NOUN is VERB to provide resources for the ADJ phase . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during NOUN , the “ first phase , ” the nuclear NOUN VERB to VERB into small vesicles , and the ADJ organelles ( such as the PROPN complex or NOUN NOUN , and NOUN NOUN ) , NOUN and VERB toward the NOUN of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB ( VERB ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> chromosomes become more ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each sister NOUN develops a protein structure called a NOUN in the NOUN region ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the proteins of the NOUN attract and bind ADJ NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during NOUN , the “ distance phase , ” the chromosomes reach the opposite NOUN and begin to PROPN ( VERB ) , VERB into a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN are VERB into ADJ NOUN that will be used to VERB ADJ components for each daughter cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during NOUN , these NOUN vesicles are transported on NOUN to form a NOUN ( a ADJ structure ) at the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there , the vesicles fuse and VERB from the center toward the cell walls ; this structure is called a cell NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as more vesicles fuse , the cell NOUN VERB until it VERB with the cell walls at the NOUN of the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the genes that code for the positive cell cycle NOUN are called NOUN - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - NOUN are normal genes that , when VERB in certain ways , become NOUN , genes that cause a cell to become ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is ADJ because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct NUM NOUN of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of cell division is called ADJ ( prokaryotic ) NOUN . ADJ NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> formation of the PROPN ring triggers the NOUN of other proteins that work together to VERB new membrane and cell wall materials to the site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is formed between the NOUN , VERB gradually from the NOUN toward the center of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the new cell walls are in place , the daughter cells separate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> haploid cells , containing a single NOUN of each homologous chromosome , are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores . <sent_end> <sent_begin> spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another NOUN to form a diploid cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm , or gametes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN complex , a NOUN of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific NOUN and then VERB to cover the entire length of the chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN of the homologous chromosomes is called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN , the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned ADV with each other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> located at NOUN along the NOUN complex are large protein NOUN called recombination NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN VERB the points of later PROPN and VERB the ADJ process of NOUN — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> near the recombination NOUN on each NOUN , the double - VERB dna is VERB , the cut ends are modified , and a new connection is made between the non - sister chromatids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the NOUN NOUN and the NOUN is broken up with the NOUN moving to NUM pole or another , the NOUN level — the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus — has been reduced from NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , meiosis i is referred to as a reduction division . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is no such reduction in NOUN level during mitosis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nearly all animals VERB a diploid - dominant life - cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> early in the development of the embryo , specialized diploid cells , called NOUN cells , are produced within the NOUN , such as the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN cells are capable of mitosis to VERB the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> supported by the NOUN , he VERB physics , NOUN , and natural science NOUN at the secondary and university levels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , he began a decade - long research NOUN involving inheritance patterns in NOUN and plants , ultimately VERB on NOUN plants as his primary model system ( a system with ADJ characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly NUM NOUN plants to the local natural history society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel was the first researcher to see it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead of continuous characteristics , mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes ( specifically , NOUN versus white flowers ) ; this is referred to as ADJ variation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel ’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see ADV that the traits were not VERB in the offspring , nor were they absorbed , but rather that they VERB their NOUN and could be passed on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel collected the seeds VERB to the NOUN plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these offspring were called the PROPN , or the first ADJ ( ADJ = offspring , daughter or NOUN ) , generation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once mendel VERB the characteristics in the ADJ generation of plants , he allowed them to self - VERB naturally . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when mendel transferred pollen from a plant with ADJ flowers to the NOUN of a plant with white flowers and vice ADV , he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent , male or female , VERB which trait . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called a ADJ cross — a VERB cross in which the ADJ traits of the male and female in NUM cross become the ADJ traits of the female and male in the other cross . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for the other NUM characteristics mendel VERB , the PROPN and PROPN NOUN VERB in the same way as they had for flower color . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the product rule states that the probability of NUM independent events occurring together can be calculated by VERB the individual NOUN of each event occurring alone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both ADV visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel ’s parental NOUN plants always VERB true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when PROPN plants with VERB traits were cross - ADJ , all of the offspring were ADJ for the VERB trait , meaning that their genotype VERB that they had different alleles for the gene being VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> beyond VERB the offspring of a cross between known ADJ or ADJ parents , mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a NOUN or a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> called the test cross , this technique is still used by plant and animal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a test cross , the dominant - VERB organism is VERB with an organism that is ADJ recessive for the same characteristic . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a variation on ADJ NOUN is NOUN , in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of NOUN is the PROPN blood groups of humans . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the sex chromosomes are NUM pair of non - homologous chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> until now , we have only considered inheritance patterns among non - sex chromosomes , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to NUM homologous pairs of NOUN , human females have a homologous pair of x chromosomes , whereas human males have an PROPN chromosome pair . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because the gene is essential , these individuals might VERB to develop past fertilization , die in NOUN , or die later in life , depending on what life stage requires this gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an inheritance pattern in which an allele is only ADJ in the ADJ form and in which the NOUN may be normal or have some VERB non - ADJ phenotype is referred to as recessive NOUN . for NOUN between ADJ individuals with a recessive ADJ allele that causes death before birth when ADJ , only wild - type NOUN and NOUN would be observed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ ratio would therefore be NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB that true - VERB NOUN plants with VERB traits gave rise to ADJ NOUN that all expressed the dominant trait and ADJ NOUN that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a NUM ratio , mendel proposed the law of segregation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this law states that VERB unit factors ( genes ) must VERB equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal NOUN of VERB either factor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , each chromosome contains NOUN or thousands of genes , organized ADV on chromosomes like NOUN on a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by NOUN , in which genes that are located ADV close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , because of the process of recombination , or “ NOUN , ” it is possible for NUM genes on the same chromosome to behave ADV , or as if they are not linked . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is now known that the NOUN and interaction between homologous chromosomes , known as PROPN , does more than simply organize the NOUN for NOUN to separate daughter cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when VERB , homologous chromosomes undergo ADJ physical NOUN at their arms in a process called homologous recombination , or more simply , “ VERB over . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conversely , alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the average number of NOUN between NUM alleles — that is , their recombination frequency — VERB with their genetic distance from each other , relative to the NOUN of other genes on that chromosome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB the example cross between PROPN and PROPN above , the frequency of recombination could be calculated as NUM = NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , NOUN pattern , and NOUN position . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to obtain a view of an individual ’s NOUN , PROPN VERB the chromosomes and then cut and VERB each chromosome into a NOUN , or PROPN , also known as an NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> disorders of chromosome number include the NOUN or loss of entire chromosomes , as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are caused by NOUN , which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids VERB to separate during meiosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ or ADJ NOUN , or a NOUN of the NOUN NOUN that VERB chromosome NOUN , can cause NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets ( NUM for diploid species ) is called ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , fertilization of an ADJ diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would VERB a ADJ zygote . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN can be ADJ and include the NOUN , or NOUN and occur outside of the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN that is ADJ about the NOUN can change the relative NOUN of the chromosome arms , making these NOUN easily ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN is a technique used to separate dna fragments of different NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> usually the NOUN is made of a chemical called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM replication NOUN are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended ADV ADV as replication NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> single - strand binding proteins VERB the single NOUN of dna near the replication NOUN to prevent the single - VERB dna from VERB back into a double helix . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dna polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the NUM ' to NUM ' direction ( a new dna strand can be only extended in this direction ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM strand , which is complementary to the NUM ' to NUM ' parental dna strand , is VERB ADV ADP the replication NOUN because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADV VERB strand is known as the leading strand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other strand , complementary to the NUM ' to NUM ' parental dna , is extended away from the replication NOUN , in small fragments known as PROPN fragments , each requiring a NOUN to start the synthesis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the overall direction of the ADJ strand will be NUM ' to NUM ' , and that of the leading strand NUM ' to NUM ' . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a protein called the VERB NOUN holds the dna polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the VERB NOUN is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the dna and holds the polymerase in place . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most of the NOUN during dna replication are ADV VERB by dna polymerase by VERB the base that has been just added ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , the dna NOUN VERB the newly added base before adding the next NUM , so a NOUN can be made . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the polymerase VERB whether the newly added base has VERB ADV with the base in the template strand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN during dna replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mutations , variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome , can also occur because of damage to dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such mutations may be of NUM types : induced or ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mutations may have a wide range of effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as ADJ mutations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN refers to a NOUN or NOUN being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a NOUN such as NOUN may be replaced by the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN refers to a NOUN being replaced by a NOUN , or vice ADV ; for example , NOUN , a NOUN , is replaced by NOUN , a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base , known as an NOUN , or the removal of a base , also known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the flow of genetic information in cells from dna to mrna to protein is described by the central PROPN ( [ link ] ) , which states that genes VERB the sequence of PROPN , which in turn VERB the sequence of proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of NUM molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this demonstrated that NUM nucleotides VERB each amino acid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these nucleotide NOUN are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of NUM or NUM nucleotides completely changed the NOUN reading frame , ADV VERB the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the central region of the cell in which prokaryotic dna VERB is called the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , prokaryotes often have ADJ NOUN , which are shorter circular dna molecules that may only contain NUM or a few genes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be transferred ADV of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as ADJ resistance . transcription in prokaryotes ( and in NOUN ) requires the dna double helix to ADV VERB in the region of mrna synthesis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that VERB to the site from which the first NUM ' mrna nucleotide is VERB is called the SYM site , or the initiation site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nucleotides VERB the initiation site are given negative numbers and are VERB ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of these subunits , VERB α , α , β , and β ' VERB the polymerase core enzyme . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these subunits VERB every time a gene is VERB , and they VERB once transcription is complete . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although NOUN vary among prokaryotic genomes , a few elements are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the NOUN and PROPN regions ADV of the initiation site , there are NUM NOUN NOUN sequences , or regions that are similar across all NOUN and across various bacterial species ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN sequence , called the NOUN region , is PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the mrna VERB back on itself , and the complementary c – g nucleotides bind together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the result is a stable NOUN that causes the polymerase to VERB as soon as it begins to VERB a region rich in a – t nucleotides . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the complementary NOUN – a region of the mrna NOUN forms only a weak interaction with the template dna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> further ADV of the PROPN NOUN , eukaryotic NOUN may also contain NUM or more NOUN - rich NOUN ( PROPN ) or NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “ active ” genes that are ADV being expressed by the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each mrna molecule is simultaneously VERB by many NOUN , all VERB protein in the same direction : reading the mrna from NUM ' to NUM ' and VERB the polypeptide from the n NOUN to the c NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the complete mrna / NOUN - NOUN structure is called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when an in - frame PROPN is VERB during translation NOUN , a non - ADJ NOUN is VERB by a ADJ met - PROPN . in e. NOUN mrna , a sequence NOUN of the first PROPN NOUN , called the PROPN - PROPN sequence ( PROPN ) , VERB with the PROPN molecules that VERB the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this interaction VERB the PROPN NOUN NOUN at the correct location on the mrna template . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during and after translation , individual amino acids may be ADV modified , signal sequences may be VERB , and the new protein “ NOUN ” into a distinct NUM - dimensional structure as a result of ADJ interactions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that VERB a protein to a specific cellular NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these sequences at the amino end or the ADJ end of the protein can be thought of as the protein ’s “ NOUN NOUN ” to its ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once NOUN is complete , the pre - mrna is VERB by an NOUN between an PROPN NOUN sequence and a PROPN - rich sequence , leaving the PROPN sequence on the pre - mrna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an enzyme called NOUN - a polymerase then VERB a NOUN of approximately NUM a NOUN , called the ADJ - a tail . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this modification further protects the pre - mrna from NOUN and signals the NOUN of the cellular factors that the NOUN needs to the cytoplasm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some of a NOUN ’s rna molecules are ADV structural , whereas others have ADJ or binding activities . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mature NOUN take on a NUM - dimensional structure through ADJ hydrogen NOUN to position the amino acid binding site at NUM end and the NOUN at the other end ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is a NUM - nucleotide sequence in a NOUN that VERB with an mrna NOUN through complementary base NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the dna of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome VERB in the ADJ region of the cell cytoplasm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> proteins that are needed for a specific function , or that are involved in the same ADJ pathway , are VERB together in blocks called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , all of the genes needed to use NOUN as an energy source are VERB next to each other in the NOUN ( or PROPN ) NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NUM genes are next to each other in what is called the NOUN ( NOUN ) NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NOUN is present in the environment , then e . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when NOUN is not present in the cell , the NOUN by itself does not bind to the NOUN ; therefore , the NOUN is active and NOUN is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the NOUN protein actively binds to the NOUN to keep the genes turned off , the NOUN NOUN is ADV regulated and the proteins that bind to the NOUN to VERB NOUN expression are negative NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN PROPN : an PROPN PROPN third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through ADJ NOUN , which have proteins that bind to VERB or VERB transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN is a typical ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NOUN of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular dna sequence NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when transcription factors bind to the NOUN just ADV of the VERB gene , it is referred to as a NOUN - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before the mrna leaves the nucleus , it is given NUM ADJ " NOUN " that prevent the end of the strand from VERB during its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM ' NOUN , which is placed on the NUM ' end of the mrna , is usually composed of a VERB NOUN NOUN molecule ( gtp ) . the ADJ - a tail , which is attached to the NUM ' end , is usually composed of a series of NOUN nucleotides . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> proteins , called rna - binding proteins , or NOUN , can bind to the regions of the rna just ADJ or ADV of the protein - VERB region . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these regions in the rna that are not VERB into protein are called the ADJ regions , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are not NOUN ( those have been removed in the nucleus ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN are made in the nucleus as longer pre - ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these pre - PROPN are VERB into mature NOUN by a protein called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like transcription factors and NOUN , mature PROPN recognize a specific sequence and bind to the rna ; however , PROPN also associate with a NOUN complex called the rna - induced NOUN complex ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in translation , the complex that VERB to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first protein to bind to the rna to VERB translation is the eukaryotic initiation PROPN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule NOUN NOUN ( gtp ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming NOUN NOUN ( gdp ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ protein bound to gtp binds to the small NUM ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when bound , the NOUN NOUN PROPN NOUN with the PROPN NOUN complex , VERB along with it the mrna to be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while these changes do n’t occur simultaneously in NUM cancer , changes at each of these levels can be VERB when VERB cancer at different sites in different individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , changes in NOUN NOUN ( ADJ modification that leads to gene NOUN ) , NOUN of transcription factors by NOUN , increased rna stability , increased ADJ control , and protein modification can all be VERB at some point in various cancer cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be VERB to VERB a NOUN cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most nucleic acid NOUN techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use ADJ reactions to VERB all macromolecules that are not VERB ( such as NOUN of ADJ molecules and separation from the dna sample ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells are broken using a NOUN NOUN ( a solution which is mostly a NOUN ) ; NOUN means “ to split . ” these enzymes break apart ADJ molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> macromolecules are VERB using enzymes such as NOUN that break down proteins , and NOUN ( PROPN ) that break down rna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dna fragments can also be VERB from an rna template in a process called reverse NOUN PROPN ( PROPN - PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first step is to VERB the original dna template strand ( called NOUN ) by VERB dna nucleotides to the mrna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be VERB with specific ADV or ADV labeled NOUN sequences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when dna is transferred to a NOUN membrane , the technique is called southern NOUN , and when rna is transferred to a NOUN membrane , it is called northern NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> southern NOUN are used to detect the presence of certain dna sequences in a given genome , and northern NOUN are used to detect gene expression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have been VERB and VERB as vectors for molecular NOUN and the large - scale production of important NOUN , such as insulin and human growth hormone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an important feature of NOUN vectors is the NOUN with which a foreign dna NOUN can be introduced via the multiple NOUN site ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is a short dna sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are also called ADJ molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be VERB back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> proteins that are expressed from ADJ dna molecules are called ADJ proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> not all ADJ NOUN are capable of VERB genes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> genetic NOUN is the NOUN of an organism ’s genotype using ADJ dna technology to VERB an organism ’s dna to achieve ADJ traits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the addition of foreign dna in the form of ADJ dna vectors generated by molecular NOUN is the most common method of genetic NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the methods used to VERB gene function are collectively called gene NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gene NOUN is the use of ADJ dna vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene , either by VERB mutations in a gene , or by VERB the expression of a certain gene by VERB a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in nature , the disease - causing NOUN PROPN have a set of NOUN , called the PROPN NOUN ( NOUN - VERB NOUN ) , that contain genes for the production of NOUN in plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dna from the PROPN NOUN VERB into the infected plant cell ’s genome . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the maps created by genome mapping are ADJ to the maps that we use to VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a genetic map is an NOUN that VERB genes and their location on a chromosome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate NOUN ) and use genetic NOUN ( similar to NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the study of genetic maps begins with NOUN analysis , a NOUN that VERB the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term NOUN was used before the discovery of dna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM methods used to create a physical map : ADJ mapping , radiation ADJ mapping , and sequence mapping . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ mapping uses information obtained by ADJ analysis of ADJ NOUN of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is possible to determine the ADJ distance between genetic NOUN using ADJ mapping , but not the ADJ distance ( number of base pairs ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sequence mapping resulted from dna sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with NOUN measured in terms of the number of base pairs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the creation of ADJ NOUN and complementary dna ( PROPN ) NOUN ( NOUN of VERB sequences or all dna from a genome ) has VERB up the process of physical mapping . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology ( a sequence - VERB site , or NOUN ) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known ADJ ADJ location . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN and visual NOUN of these NOUN could ADV be highly VERB , VERB , and even VERB , since their goal was the effective NOUN of social NOUN they thought required reform . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN , such as PROPN PROPN , who wrote the call of the wild , VERB a school of thought called NOUN , which VERB that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only ADV ADJ laws VERB NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN VERB with his NOUN PROPN in NUM ( a ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cover of PROPN PROPN ’s the call of the wild ( b ) shows the dogs in the ADJ environment of the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the campaign was a typical NUM for the era : democrats VERB a NOUN on earlier republican NOUN , such as the PROPN PROPN NOUN , and republicans VERB upon the ADJ NOUN campaign , VERB the nation of the ADJ human NOUN of the war against southern NOUN who now VERB in national politics under the NOUN of the democratic party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president grant previously had great success with the “ ADJ NOUN ” strategy in the NUM election , when republican supporters VERB democratic candidate PROPN PROPN for his NOUN with new york city NOUN NOUN during the war . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with his efforts ADP VERB african american civil rights VERB by a democratic congress , and his decision to VERB the NOUN of NOUN ADV adding to the pressures of the economic panic of NUM , PROPN VERB to achieve any significant legislation during his presidency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , he did make a few NOUN ADP civil service reform . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the state level , specifically in PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , the PROPN of PROPN did ADV VERB in VERB the passage of PROPN laws , which regulated some NOUN rates along with the prices charged by NOUN NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the movement also created a political party — the PROPN party , so named for its support of NOUN currency ( or “ NOUN ” ) not based upon a gold standard — which saw brief success with the election of NUM NOUN . however , such NOUN were short - lived and had little impact on the lives of everyday farmers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the causes of the depression of NUM were ADJ , but NUM major element was the NOUN in NOUN over the previous decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rapid NOUN of NOUN lines created a false NOUN of growth for the economy as a whole . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> however , the NOUN of NOUN and insects have evolved from very different original structures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this phenomenon is called ADJ evolution , where similar traits VERB ADV in species that do not share a common NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM species came to the same function , VERB , but did so ADV from each other . these physical changes occur over ADJ NOUN of time and help explain how evolution occurs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> individual organisms will mate with any ADJ individual who they are capable of VERB with . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an area where NUM closely related species continue to interact and reproduce , forming NOUN , is called a ADJ zone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over time , the ADJ zone may change depending on the NOUN of the NOUN and the reproductive barriers ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the ADJ NOUN model , species VERB gradually over time in small steps . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the ADJ equilibrium model , a new species VERB changes quickly from the parent species , and then remains largely ADJ for long periods of time ADV ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this early change model is called ADJ equilibrium , because it begins with a ADJ or ADJ change and then remains in balance ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> given the ADJ diversity of life on the NOUN there must be mechanisms for NOUN : the formation of NUM species from NUM original species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB this process as a VERB event and VERB the process in the only NOUN found in on the origin of species ( [ PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN group ADJ processes into NUM categories : NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is when a few members of a species move to a new ADJ area , and PROPN is when a natural situation VERB to ADV divide organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the other form of NOUN occurs when individuals of NUM different species reproduce to form a ADJ offspring called an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN “ NOUN ” means “ other ” ( recall from ADJ ) : therefore , an NOUN occurs when gametes from NUM different species combine . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , a ADJ barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> behavioral NOUN occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior VERB reproduction from taking place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , male NOUN use specific light patterns to attract females . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> initially , the newly discovered NOUN nature of genes made it difficult for NOUN to understand how ADJ evolution could occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but over the next few decades NOUN and evolution were VERB in what became known as the modern synthesis — the ADJ understanding of the relationship between natural selection and NOUN that took shape by the NOUN and is generally accepted today . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the ADJ evolution of populations and species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the allele frequency ( or gene frequency ) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms , but behind that ADJ change is genetic change . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if these are the only NUM possible alleles for a given NOUN in the population , p + q = NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that NOUN that are found in the population . but what ultimately interests most NOUN is not the frequencies of different alleles , but the frequencies of the resulting NOUN , known as the population ’s genetic structure , from which scientists can VERB the distribution of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the phenotype is observed , only the genotype of the ADJ recessive alleles can be known ; the NOUN provide an NOUN of the remaining NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the diversity of alleles and NOUN within a population is called genetic NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when scientists are involved in the NOUN of a species , such as with animals in NOUN and nature NOUN , they try to increase a population ’s genetic NOUN to preserve as much of the ADJ diversity as they can . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> over time , the genes for ADJ size will increase in frequency in the population , and the population will , as a result , grow larger on average . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , this would occur if this particular selection pressure , or driving ADJ force , were the only NUM acting on the population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other examples , better NOUN or a stronger resistance to NOUN might VERB a selection pressure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another important evolutionary force is gene flow : the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the NOUN of individuals or gametes ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while some populations are fairly stable , others experience more NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the ADJ variation between those populations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such ADJ variation is seen between most populations and can be significant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM type of geographic variation , called a PROPN , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ADJ gradient . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that , for example , increases the ability to reproduce ( NOUN ) , but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a ADJ childhood disease , that NOUN phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age . <sent_end> <sent_begin> natural selection acts at the level of the individual ; it VERB for individuals with greater contributions to the gene NOUN of the next generation , known as an organism ’s evolutionary ( PROPN ) NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the environment changes , populations will often undergo ADJ selection ( [ link ] ) , which VERB for NOUN at NUM end of the spectrum of existing variation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ example of this type of selection is the evolution of the VERB NOUN in NOUN and nineteenth - century england . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> males are often larger , for example , and display many ADJ NOUN and NOUN , like the NOUN ’s tail , while females tend to be smaller and ADJ in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such differences are known as sexual NOUN ( [ link ] ) , which arise from the fact that in many populations , particularly animal populations , there is more NOUN in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , some males — often the ADJ , stronger , or more VERB males — get the vast majority of the total NOUN , while others receive NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , NOUN ronald PROPN proposed another model of sexual selection : the ADJ ADJ model , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual NOUN . in both the NOUN principle and the good genes hypothesis , the trait is said to be an ADJ signal of the males ’ quality , thus giving females a way to find the ADJ NOUN — males that will pass the best genes to their offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many ADJ trees have a single NOUN at the base representing a common NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists call such trees VERB , which means there is a single ADJ NOUN ( typically drawn from the bottom or left ) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB in the VERB ADJ tree that the NUM NOUN — bacteria , PROPN , and PROPN — VERB from a single point and branch off . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN that evolved early from the root and remains ADJ is called basal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM NOUN stem from the same branch point , they are called sister NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a branch with more than NUM NOUN is called a NOUN and serves to VERB where scientists have not ADV determined all of the relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( which literally means “ arrangement law ” ) is the science of VERB organisms to VERB ADV shared NOUN systems with each organism placed into more and more ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> think about how a NOUN store is organized . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with the NOUN of dna technology , the area of molecular NOUN , which describes the use of information on the molecular level including dna analysis , has VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new computer programs not only VERB many earlier classified organisms , but also VERB previously made NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a characteristic is found in the NOUN of a group , it is considered a shared ADJ NOUN because all of the organisms in the NOUN or NOUN have that trait . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN in [ link ] is a shared ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> horizontal gene transfer ( PROPN ) is the NOUN of genetic material from NUM species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from PROPN ) to offspring . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN allow even ADV related species to share genes , VERB their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleus - first hypothesis VERB that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link ] a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new NOUN with bacteria that became mitochondria . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mitochondria - first hypothesis VERB that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ PROPN ) , which ADV acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] a , some individual prokaryotes were responsible for VERB the bacteria that caused NOUN development to the new NOUN , whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this model is often called the “ web of life . ” in an effort to save the tree NOUN , some have proposed using the PROPN tree ( [ PROPN ) with its multiple NOUN as a NOUN to represent a ADJ evolutionary role for X the ( a ) ADJ model proposed by w. PROPN PROPN , the “ tree of life ” VERB from a community of ADJ cells , has multiple NOUN , and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , this concept is better represented by ( b ) the ADJ - ADJ PROPN than by the single NOUN of the NOUN similar to the tree drawn by PROPN [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all NOUN have a nucleic acid genome covered by a ADJ layer of proteins , called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is made up of protein subunits called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some viral NOUN are simple ADJ “ NOUN , ” whereas others are quite complex in structure . in general , the shapes of viruses are classified into NUM groups : ADJ , ADJ ( or ADJ ) , VERB , and head and tail . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unlike nearly all living organisms that use dna as their genetic material , viruses may use either dna or rna as PRON . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> viral genomes tend to be small , containing only those genes that VERB proteins that the virus can not get from the host cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they convert their single - VERB genomes into a NOUN intermediate before transcription to mrna can occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group PROPN viruses use NUM as their genome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN separate , and NUM of them is used as a template for the generation of mrna using the rna - dependent rna polymerase VERB by the virus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> then , mrna can be produced by transcription of the viral dna that was VERB into the host genome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group PROPN viruses have partial NOUN genomes and make NOUN NOUN that act as mrna , but are also converted back into ADJ genomes by reverse NOUN , necessary for genome replication . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the characteristics of each group in the PROPN NOUN are VERB in [ link ] with examples of each group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these changes , called ADJ ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even VERB the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as NOUN , die through NOUN ( VERB ) or NOUN ( VERB cell death or “ cell PROPN ” ) , releasing all ADJ NOUN at once . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and VERB the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are viruses that VERB bacteria ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when infection of a cell by a NOUN results in the production of new NOUN , the infection is said to be productive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes , however , a virus can remain within the cell without being released . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , when a ADJ NOUN VERB a bacterial cell , it VERB by means of a ADJ cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is VERB into the genome of the host cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the NOUN dna is VERB into the host cell genome , it is called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the viral genome is then “ VERB ” into the host cell through these channels in a manner ADJ to that used by many NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB viruses also have NUM ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors : receptor - VERB NOUN , or fusion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many VERB viruses enter the cell by receptor - VERB NOUN in a NOUN similar to some non - VERB viruses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other viruses cause long - term ADJ NOUN , such as the virus causing NOUN c , whereas others , like NOUN NOUN virus , only cause ADJ symptoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> still other viruses , such as human PROPN NUM and NUM , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease PROPN , often successfully cause productive NOUN without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an ADJ infection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM common NOUN is NOUN , the ADJ NOUN of cells that causes the appearance of plant NOUN known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other viruses VERB NOUN , or VERB cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while we do have limited numbers of effective ADJ drugs , such as those used to treat PROPN and NOUN , the primary method of VERB viral disease is by NOUN , which is intended to prevent NOUN by building NOUN to a virus or virus family ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN may be VERB using live viruses , killed viruses , or molecular subunits of the virus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the killed viral NOUN and NOUN viruses are both ADJ of causing disease . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non - viral diseases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> viruses have been used in gene therapy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined NOUN ( PROPN ) , a ADJ , recessive disease in which children are born with ADV VERB immune systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN are pathogens ( NOUN with the ability to cause disease ) that have ADJ structures than viruses but , in the case of NOUN , still can produce ADJ diseases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN are plant pathogens : small , single - VERB , circular rna particles that are much ADJ than a virus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they do not have a NOUN or outer NOUN , but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first ADJ NOUN likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN is a NOUN or NOUN in the earth ’s surface that releases ADV ADJ water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with the evolution of photosynthesis about NUM NUM years ago , some prokaryotes in ADJ NOUN came to use a more widely available energy source — sunlight — whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from ADJ NOUN for energy and food . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> evidence indicates that during the first NUM NUM years of earth ’s existence , the atmosphere was ADJ , meaning that there was no molecular oxygen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — ADJ organisms — were able to live . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ organisms that convert ADJ energy into chemical energy are called PROPN , and they appeared within NUM NUM years of the formation of earth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other bacteria and NOUN are VERB to grow under extreme conditions and are called NOUN , meaning “ NOUN of NOUN . ” NOUN have been found in all kinds of environments : the depth of the NOUN , ADJ NOUN , the PROPN and the PROPN , in very ADJ places , deep inside earth , in ADJ chemical environments , and in high radiation environments ( [ link ] ) , just to VERB a few . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new ADJ drugs or have industrial NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN for entering into the NOUN state are not completely understood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a process called NOUN , the NOUN can go back to “ normal ” life when environmental conditions improve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , the NOUN found in some species enables the organism to VERB to surfaces , protects it from NOUN and attack by ADJ cells , and makes pathogens more ADJ to our immune responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some species also have NOUN ( singular , NOUN ) used for NOUN , and PROPN ( singular , NOUN ) used for attachment to surfaces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , which consist of extra - ADJ dna , are also present in many species of bacteria and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> bacteria are divided into NUM major groups : PROPN positive and PROPN negative , based on their reaction to PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that all PROPN - positive bacteria belong to NUM phylum ; bacteria in the other NOUN ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and others ) are NOUN - negative . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , the NOUN takes in dna found in its environment that is VERB by other prokaryotes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a ADJ NOUN takes up dna for a NOUN gene from a pathogen and VERB the new dna into its own chromosome , it too may become ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall that macromolecules are produced by the NOUN of smaller units called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for cells to build all of the molecules required to VERB life , they need certain substances , collectively called nutrients . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when prokaryotes grow in nature , they obtain their nutrients from the environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere . <sent_end> <sent_begin> then , bacteria and fungi , collectively called NOUN , carry out the NOUN ( NOUN ) of plants and animals and their organic compounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most important NOUN of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is ADJ NOUN of dead material ( dead animals , plants , and NOUN ) that undergo respiration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ammonia is VERB ADV by some prokaryotes , VERB PROPN as the final product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the NOUN of NOUN to NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN in soils is carried out by bacteria VERB to the NOUN PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN is a disease that occurs in an ADV high number of individuals in a population at the same time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a widespread , usually worldwide , NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ disease is a disease that is ADV present , usually at low NOUN , in a population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , changes in the environment , the pathogen , or the host population can ADV impact the spread of a disease . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the world health organization ( who ) an VERB disease ( [ link ] ) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time , or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in NOUN or geographic range . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this definition also includes re - VERB diseases that were previously under control . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , PROPN NOUN , often called “ NOUN , ” is a common NOUN that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a very dangerous NOUN , however , NOUN - ADJ PROPN NOUN ( PROPN ) has made the news over the past few years ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN is ADJ to many commonly used NOUN , including NOUN , PROPN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the united states has NUM of the ADJ food NOUN in the world , the u.s. centers for disease control and PROPN ( PROPN ) has reported that “ NUM NUM people get ADJ , more than NUM are VERB , and NUM americans die each year from ADJ illness . ADJ characteristics of ADJ NOUN have changed over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the past , it was relatively common to hear about ADJ cases of NOUN , the ADV ADJ disease produced by a NOUN from the ADJ NOUN PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of the most common sources for this NOUN were non - ADJ ADJ NOUN , ADJ NOUN , and VERB NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN may VERB more nitrogen in soils than free - living organisms by a factor of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> soil bacteria , collectively called NOUN , are able to ADV interact with NOUN to form NOUN , specialized structures where nitrogen NOUN occurs ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , the enzyme that VERB nitrogen , is VERB by oxygen , so the NOUN provides an oxygen - free area for nitrogen NOUN to take place . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully , it is necessary to understand that all ADJ NOUN are NOUN of a ADJ organism that was a NOUN of a host cell and the PROPN ) of an NOUN - NOUN that “ took up NOUN ” inside it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this major NOUN in the origin of NOUN is known as NOUN , NUM cell VERB another such that the ADJ cell VERB and both cells benefit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over many NOUN , a ADJ relationship can result in NUM organisms that VERB on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ cells may be VERB by animal - like cell membranes or plant - like cell walls . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others are VERB in ADJ NOUN - based NOUN or NOUN with NOUN of VERB protein NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN functions like a ADJ NOUN of NOUN , preventing the NOUN from being VERB or VERB without VERB its range of motion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> until recently , these NOUN were believed to lack mitochondria . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ ADJ organelles , called NOUN , have since been identified in NOUN , but these NOUN are essentially ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN exist in ADJ environments and use alternative NOUN , such as NOUN , to generate energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> together , the NOUN contribute to the characteristic NOUN motion of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN exist in ADJ and marine NOUN , and are a component of NOUN , the typically ADJ organisms that VERB through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most species of NOUN reproduce ADV , although some instances of sexual reproduction and NOUN also exist . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN exhibit a NOUN in their NOUN shell , called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by VERB a NOUN of NOUN from the NOUN , the NOUN can VERB to surfaces or VERB itself in NUM direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , or NOUN , are ADJ ADJ NOUN , VERB from approximately NUM NOUN to several NOUN in length , and ADV VERB ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a group , the PROPN exhibit ADJ NOUN , called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically VERB with calcium NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the tests may house photosynthetic algae , which the NOUN can VERB for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in addition , their NOUN of NOUN was ADV understood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> progress in the field of ADJ biology was the result of NOUN : the scientific study of fungi . <sent_end> <sent_begin> based on fossil evidence , fungi appeared in the pre - ADJ era , about NUM NUM years ago . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they display NUM distinct ADJ stages : the ADJ and reproductive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ stage consists of a NOUN of ADJ NOUN - like structures called NOUN ( singular , NOUN ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mass of NOUN is a NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN in NOUN NOUN ( which belong to the phylum PROPN ) are not separated by PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei , an arrangement described as ADJ NOUN ( [ NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other species , such as the PROPN that VERB in the NOUN of NOUN , are are ADJ NOUN , in that they only use ADJ respiration because oxygen will VERB their metabolism or VERB them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are intermediate , being ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using ADJ respiration , but can survive using ADJ respiration when oxygen is not available . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and VERB new environments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they may be released from the parent ADP either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although there are many variations in ADJ sexual reproduction , all include the following NUM stages ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , during PROPN ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , NUM haploid cells fuse , leading to a ADJ stage where NUM haploid nuclei VERB in a single cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during PROPN ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN are a relatively small group of fungi VERB to the phylum PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they include the familiar NOUN NOUN , PROPN PROPN , which rapidly VERB on the surfaces of NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in each NOUN , NUM or more haploid NOUN fuse their nuclei in PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during sexual reproduction , thousands of PROPN VERB a VERB body called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ PROPN and PROPN fungi — those that do not display a sexual phase — use to be classified in the form phylum PROPN , , a NOUN group no longer used in the present , ever - developing NOUN of organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while PROPN use to be a NOUN group , recent NOUN analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the PROPN or the PROPN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fossil NOUN indicate that trees and their root NOUN share a long evolutionary history . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it appears that all members of this family form PROPN NOUN : the NOUN interact with the root cells forming a ADV beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the NOUN , and the NOUN VERB essential NOUN from the soil to the plant . the NOUN do not reproduce ADV and do not survive without the presence of plant roots . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although they have ADJ NOUN like the PROPN , they do not form PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fungi can affect animals , including humans , in several ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a ADJ disease that results from infection and direct damage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> fungi attack animals directly by VERB and VERB tissues . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the most ADJ NOUN between fungi and plants is the establishment of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , which comes from the greek words PROPN meaning NOUN and PROPN meaning root , refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their ADJ fungi . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV between NUM and NUM percent of all plant species have NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN display a range of NOUN and NOUN ( [ link ] ) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they cover NOUN , NOUN , tree NOUN , and the ground in the NOUN where plant roots can not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in both ADJ and seed plants , the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB feature of land plants gave the group its ADJ name of PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after VERB from a NOUN , the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female NOUN , usually on the same individual . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , ADJ plants produce NUM ADV different types of spores . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the male spores are called NOUN , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the ADV larger NOUN develop into the female gametophyte . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the spores of ADJ plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a ADJ NOUN known as PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this complex substance is characterized by long NOUN of organic molecules related to fatty acids and NOUN : hence the yellow color of most pollen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the male NOUN ( PROPN ) releases sperm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many ADJ plants produce sperm VERB with NOUN that enable them to VERB in a ADJ environment to the PROPN : the female NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the embryo develops inside the NOUN as the sporophyte . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cells in green algae divide along cell NOUN called NOUN , and their cell walls are VERB in the same manner as the cell walls of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new ADJ group called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN ( PROPN ) belong to the broad NOUN group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they have VERB a variety of NOUN on land , although they are never far from a source of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN follows the pattern of NOUN of NOUN as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which VERB from a haploid NOUN and forms first a PROPN — usually , a NOUN of single - ADJ NOUN that VERB the ground . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells ADJ to an apical NOUN actively divide and give rise to a PROPN , consisting of a photosynthetic stem and NOUN - like structures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the vascular plants , or NOUN , are the dominant and most ADJ group of land plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more than NUM species of NOUN represent more than NUM percent of earth ’s NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phloem is the second type of vascular tissue ; it VERB sugars , proteins , and other NOUN throughout the plant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> phloem cells are divided into NOUN elements ( conducting cells ) and cells that support the NOUN elements . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN may have VERB from the NOUN of lateral branches , or from NOUN that lost their reproductive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are present in the NOUN NOUN and probably VERB the development of PROPN , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN most likely appeared ADV several times during the course of evolution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN , or phylum PROPN , are the ADJ group of ADJ vascular plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they dominated the NOUN of the PROPN , growing into ADJ trees and forming large NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN : class PROPN ( ADP their large NOUN , ferns are the most ADV ADJ ADJ vascular plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are considered the most ADJ ADJ vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , meaning “ ADJ seeds , ” are a diverse group of seed plants and are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ groups are those in which not all members are NOUN of a single common NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> male and female NOUN are produced either on the same plant , described as ADJ ( “ NUM home ” or ADJ ) , or on separate plants , referred to as ADJ ( “ NUM homes ” or ADJ ) plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the life cycle of a NOUN will serve as our example of reproduction in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> female cones , or VERB cones , contain NUM NOUN per scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM NOUN mother cell , or PROPN , VERB meiosis in each NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the NUM cells break down ; only a single VERB cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte , which VERB PROPN ( an NOUN is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual . <sent_end> <sent_begin> phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( dna ) inherited from one ’s parents . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( b ) phenotype describes an individual ’s ADJ characteristics , such as hair color , skin color , height , and build . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this example , we will call the gene for PROPN PROPN “ b , ” and the gene for smooth PROPN “ b. ” PROPN PROPN is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from NUM parent ( PROPN ) or both parents ( PROPN ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when someone has NUM NOUN of the same allele , they are said to be ADJ for that allele . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( a ) a PROPN NOUN is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the capital b represents the dominant allele , and the NOUN b represents the recessive allele . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most traits are ADJ : controlled by more than NUM gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> height is NUM example of a ADJ trait , as are skin color and weight . in this PROPN NOUN , n represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NUM individuals mate who are both ADJ for the allele associated with PROPN , their offspring have a NUM % chance of VERB the PROPN phenotype . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB this site for an engaging NOUN NOUN on the NOUN of ADJ studies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system , NUM NUM strong at birth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleus of the neuron is located in the NOUN , or cell body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN has VERB NOUN known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the neuron is a small information NOUN , and NOUN serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN range in length from a NOUN of an NOUN to several NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some NOUN , ADJ cells form a fatty substance known as the NOUN NOUN , which VERB the axon and acts as an NOUN , increasing the speed at which the signal VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system : the loss of the NOUN it provides can be ADJ to normal function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we begin at the ADJ membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the neuron exists in a fluid environment — it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid ( i.e. , cytoplasm ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ membrane VERB these NUM fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the NOUN and extracellular fluids being ADV different . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the action potential is an all - or - NOUN phenomenon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in simple terms , this means that an ADJ signal from another neuron is either sufficient or ADJ to reach the threshold of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons , and we can VERB in broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ drugs can act as NOUN or NOUN for a given neurotransmitter system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are chemicals that VERB a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , VERB its effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN , on the other hand , blocks or VERB the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is involved in the NOUN of sensory and motor information to and from the PROPN ; therefore , it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM systems have complementary functions , operating in NOUN to maintain the body ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a state of equilibrium , in which biological conditions ( such as body temperature ) are maintained at ADJ levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the spinal NOUN can be said that the spinal cord is what VERB the brain to the outside world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of it , the brain can act . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is evidence of some NOUN of function — referred to as NOUN — in each NOUN , mainly regarding differences in language ability . <sent_end> <sent_begin> beyond that , however , the differences that have been found have been minor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of the PROPN NUM NOUN of the brain are the frontal , ADJ , temporal , and ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the frontal lobe is located in the forward part of the brain , VERB back to a NOUN known as the central NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN 's case occurred in the NOUN of a ADJ century debate over NOUN — regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the basis of extremely limited information about PROPN , the extent of his NOUN , and his life before and after the NOUN , scientists VERB to find support for their own views , on DET side of the debate they VERB ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) PROPN PROPN holds the NOUN NOUN that VERB his skull in an NUM NOUN construction NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( b ) PROPN ’s ADJ cortex was ADV VERB in the left NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the NOUN ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ lobe is located at the very back of the brain , and contains the primary visual cortex , which is responsible for VERB ADJ visual information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ cortex is organized ADV , which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person ’s visual field and the position of that object ’s representation on the cortex . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ system is involved in processing both emotion and memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , the sense of NOUN projects directly to the ADJ system ; therefore , not ADV , NOUN can VERB emotional responses in ways that other sensory NOUN can not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is involved in our experience of emotion and in VERB emotional meaning to our memories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hypothalamus VERB a number of ADJ processes , including the regulation of body temperature , NOUN , and blood pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hypothalamus also serves as an NOUN between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual NOUN and behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN structures <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is VERB of structures located deep within the brain , between the NOUN and the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ formation is VERB in the NOUN , but it actually extends up into the NOUN and down into the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ formation is important in VERB the sleep / wake cycle , arousal , NOUN , and motor activity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it contains the medulla , PROPN , and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the medulla controls the automatic processes of the ADJ nervous system , such as NOUN , blood pressure , and heart rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word PROPN literally means “ NOUN , ” and as the name suggests , the PROPN serves to VERB the brain and spinal cord . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on february NUM , NUM , a florida woman named PROPN PROPN went into ADJ NOUN , ADV VERB by a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> she was eventually VERB , but her brain had been VERB of oxygen for a long time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN emission NOUN ( PROPN ) NOUN create NOUN of the living , active brain ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an individual receiving a ADJ ADJ NOUN or is VERB with a ADV ADJ substance , called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some situations , it is ADJ to gain an understanding of the overall activity of a person ’s brain , without VERB information on the actual location of the activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( PROPN ) serves this purpose by providing a measure of a brain ’s electrical activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN of NOUN is placed around a person ’s head ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> located in the NOUN , the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth , metabolism , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , or PROPN ’s disease , the thyroid VERB too much of the hormone NOUN , causing NOUN , VERB eyes , and weight loss . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these ADJ hormones are essential for VERB stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by VERB blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people who VERB from NOUN do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take NOUN that stimulate or VERB insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume . the NOUN secrete sexual hormones , which are important in reproduction , and VERB both sexual NOUN and behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the female NOUN are the NOUN ; the male NOUN are the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB this NOUN to see an example of a NOUN form . while the ADJ NOUN form should be as ADJ as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing , sometimes NOUN is necessary to prevent participants ’ knowledge of the ADJ research question from VERB the results of the study . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves ADV VERB experiment participants in order to maintain the NOUN of the experiment , but not to the point where the NOUN could be considered ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their NOUN , we might use NOUN in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from VERB participants ’ responses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> often , these researchers use NOUN ( [ link ] ) or birds as the subjects of their experiments — the apa VERB that NUM % of all animal research in psychology uses these species ( american psychological association , PROPN d. ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because many basic processes in animals are ADV similar to those in humans , these animals are acceptable NOUN for research that would be considered ADJ in human participants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can measure correlation by VERB a NOUN known as a correlation NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a correlation NOUN is a number from X to PUNCT that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the correlation NOUN is usually represented by the NOUN r . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ research is useful because it allows us to VERB the strength and direction of relationships that exist between NUM variables . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , correlation is limited because VERB the existence of a relationship VERB us little about cause and effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while variables are sometimes VERB because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a VERB variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we also tend to make the NOUN of ADJ NOUN , especially with ADJ observations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , or false NOUN , occur when people believe that relationships exist between NUM things when no such relationship exists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM well - known ADJ correlation is the VERB effect that the NOUN ’s phases have on human behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order to conduct an experiment , a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you VERB learned , NOUN can be VERB either through direct observation of the real world or after ADJ review of previous research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the people who VERB and record the children ’s behavior are ADJ of who was VERB to the experimental or control group , in order to control for NOUN bias . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN bias refers to the possibility that a researcher ’s expectations might VERB the results of the study . <sent_end> <sent_begin> remember , conducting an experiment requires a NOUN of NOUN , and the people involved in the research project have a ADJ interest in supporting their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because by doing so , we can control for both NOUN and NOUN expectations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you are familiar with the NOUN NOUN effect , you already have some idea as to why this is an important NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN effect occurs when people 's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include . <sent_end> <sent_begin> participants are the subjects of psychological research , and as the name implies , individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> often , psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> random NOUN is critical for sound experimental design . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with ADV large NOUN , random NOUN makes it ADJ that there are systematic differences between the groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV VERB or VERB studies can be VERB out , and even well - designed research can be VERB by the NOUN suggested . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN review also VERB that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to VERB it , meaning they can VERB the experiment using different NOUN to determine NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes NOUN involve additional measures that expand on the original finding . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ research , scientists are conducting a ADJ or case study when they focus on NUM person or just a few individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , some scientists spend their entire NOUN studying just NUM – NUM individuals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the information provided by these studies is ADJ in understanding how those animals organize ADV and communicate with NUM another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN PROPN PROPN , for example , spent nearly NUM decades VERB the behavior of NOUN in africa ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as an NOUN of the types of concerns that a researcher might VERB in ADJ observation , some scientists VERB PROPN for giving the NOUN names instead of VERB to them by numbers — using names was thought to VERB the emotional NOUN required for the NOUN of the study ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to protect against this type of bias , researchers should have clear NOUN established for the types of behaviors VERB and how those behaviors should be classified . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple NOUN , in order to test ADJ - ADJ NOUN : a measure of NOUN that VERB the NOUN of observations by different NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , they use existing NOUN to answer various research questions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of research approach is known as ADJ research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ research VERB on looking at past NOUN or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even without significant life changes , some people may simply choose to VERB their participation in the project . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , the NOUN rates , or reduction in the number of research participants due to NOUN , in ADJ studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , researchers using this approach typically VERB many participants fully VERB that a substantial number will VERB out before the end . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the end , research is what makes the difference between facts and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> facts are ADJ NOUN , and NOUN are personal NOUN , NOUN , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through ADJ research . the process of scientific research <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientific knowledge is VERB through a process known as the scientific method . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we VERB stated that theories and NOUN are ideas , but what NOUN of ideas are they , exactly ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> a theory is a well - developed set of ideas that VERB an explanation for observed phenomena . <sent_end> <sent_begin> theories are ADV VERB against the world , but they tend to be too complex to be VERB all at once ; instead , researchers create NOUN to test specific aspects of a theory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a scientific hypothesis is also ADJ , or capable of being shown to be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall from the ADJ chapter that PROPN freud had NOUN of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , a major NOUN of freud ’s theories is that many of his ideas are not ADJ ; for example , it is impossible to imagine ADJ observations that would VERB the existence of the i d , the NOUN , and the NOUN — the NUM elements of personality described in freud ’s theories . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the scientific method is also a form of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ method for VERB knowledge is NUM based on observation , including NOUN , rather than a method based only on forms of ADJ argument or previous NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some areas in psychology , it is common for individuals who have recently earned their NOUN to seek out positions in ADJ NOUN programs that are available before going on to serve as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in most cases , young scientists will complete NUM or NUM ADJ programs before VERB for a full - time NOUN position . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the name suggests , NOUN VERB how our biology VERB our behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while biological psychology is a broad field , many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as mentioned in the previous section , the cognitive revolution created an NOUN for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that VERB behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying NOUN , or thoughts , and their relationship to our experiences and our actions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like biological psychology , cognitive psychology is broad in its NOUN and often involves NOUN among people from a diverse range of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique . <sent_end> <sent_begin> several individuals ( e.g. , freud and PROPN ) that we have already discussed in our ADJ NOUN of psychology , and the american psychologist PROPN PROPN , VERB to early theories of personality . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others , prejudice , and NOUN , and how we VERB ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and ADJ factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this particular approach is known as the ADJ model ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the NOUN and treatment of psychological disorders and other ADJ patterns of behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some NOUN are also actively VERB in scientific research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ psychology is a branch of psychology that VERB questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , ADJ psychologists ( and ADJ NOUN ) will VERB a person ’s NOUN to VERB trial , VERB the state of mind of a NOUN , act as NOUN on child NOUN cases , VERB on NOUN and treatment NOUN , and VERB on issues such as NOUN NOUN and children ’s NOUN ( american board of PROPN psychology , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these experimental requirements were put in place to VERB “ interpretation ” in the NOUN of internal experiences and to VERB the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is VERB their mind or consciousness ADV , since it can not be seen by any other person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN established his psychology NOUN at the university at PROPN in NUM ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps NUM of the most ADJ and well - known NOUN in psychology ’s history was PROPN freud ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> freud ( NUM – NUM ) was an ADJ NOUN who was VERB by patients VERB from “ NOUN ” and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned NOUN , in which an animal or human produced a NOUN ( unconscious ) response to a stimulus and , over time , was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the NOUN associated with the original stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN has also led to research on environmental NOUN on human behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> b. f. skinner ( NUM – NUM ) was an american psychologist ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like PROPN , skinner was a NOUN , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> abraham PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) was an american psychologist who is best known for VERB a NOUN of human needs in VERB behavior ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief NOUN will be provided here . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> awareness of internal stimuli includes VERB pain , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and being aware of our thoughts and emotions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> biological NOUN are internal NOUN of biological activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a woman ’s ADJ cycle is an example of a biological NOUN — a VERB , ADJ pattern of ADJ changes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the brain , the hypothalamus , which VERB above the pituitary gland , is a main center of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the tendency to maintain a balance , or ADJ level , within a biological system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM important NOUN of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases NOUN , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological NOUN and of the immune system during sleep ( PROPN , PROPN - PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN release is stimulated by NOUN and VERB by light . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN is a collection of symptoms that results from the NOUN between our internal ADJ cycles and our environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these symptoms include NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or VERB ADJ for at least NUM NOUN a week over a NOUN ’s time ) ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we grow older , we sleep less . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , a ADJ - analysis , which is a study that VERB the results of many related studies , conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are NUM years old , we average fewer than NUM hours of sleep per day ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the amount of time we sleep varies over our NOUN , ADV the sleep debt would VERB ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sleep can be divided into NUM different general phases : rem sleep and non - rem ( PROPN ) sleep . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep is characterized by VERB movements of the eyes under closed NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> brain waves during rem sleep appear very similar to brain waves during NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in terms of brain wave activity , stage NUM sleep is associated with both NOUN and NOUN waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the early portion of stage NUM sleep produces NOUN waves , which are relatively low frequency ( NUM – NUM hz ) , high amplitude patterns of electrical activity ( waves ) that become VERB ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern of brain wave activity VERB that of someone who is very ADJ , yet ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN waves still VERB the activity of the brain , but they are VERB by brief NOUN of activity known as sleep NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a sleep NOUN is a rapid NOUN of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory ( PROPN & smith , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , the appearance of k - PROPN is often associated with stage NUM sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by the late ADJ century , german NOUN PROPN freud had become ADJ that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by VERB dreams , freud thought people could increase self - awareness and gain ADJ NOUN to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ century ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN believed that dreams allowed us to VERB into the collective unconscious . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the collective unconscious , as described by PROPN , is a ADJ NOUN of information he believed to be shared by everyone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , certain NOUN in dreams VERB universal NOUN with NOUN that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is NUM of a group of sleep disorders in which ADJ , ADJ motor activity and/or experiences during sleep play a role . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN can occur in either rem or PROPN phases of sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a person with ADJ NOUN syndrome has ADJ NOUN in the NOUN during periods of NOUN or when trying to fall ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN is VERB by ADV moving the NOUN , which , not ADV , VERB to difficulty in falling or VERB ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM types of sleep NOUN : ADJ sleep NOUN and central sleep NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ sleep NOUN occurs when an individual ’s NOUN becomes VERB during sleep , and air is VERB from entering the lungs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in central sleep NOUN , NOUN in signals sent from the brain that regulate NOUN cause periods of ADJ NOUN ( white , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most common NOUN for sleep NOUN involves the use of a special device during sleep . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ NOUN death syndrome ( PROPN ) an NOUN VERB VERB during sleep and VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ADJ than NUM months appear to be at the highest risk for PROPN , and NOUN have a greater risk than NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fifth NOUN of the diagnostic and statistical PROPN of mental disorders , fifth PROPN ( dsm-5 ) is used by NOUN to VERB individuals VERB from various psychological disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> drug use disorders are ADJ disorders , and the NOUN for specific substance ( drug ) use disorders are described in dsm-5 . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , a person who has psychological NOUN has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to VERB psychological distress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is linked to physiological NOUN , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can cause the NOUN to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level — even to the point of NOUN and death . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of ADJ activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of these drugs act as NOUN of the NOUN neurotransmitter system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while NOUN is generally considered a relatively safe drug , high blood levels of NOUN can result in NOUN , NOUN , muscle NOUN , NOUN , ADJ NOUN , and even death ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , PROPN and PROPN reported on a case study of a ADJ - old woman who VERB significant ADJ effects from her use of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , ADJ drugs , which VERB this ADJ ADJ mechanism , have an extremely high potential for abuse . <sent_end> <sent_begin> natural NOUN , called NOUN , are NOUN of NOUN , which is a naturally occurring compound found in the ADJ plant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are now several ADJ NOUN of NOUN drugs ( ADV called NOUN ) that have very ADJ ADJ effects , and they are often VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is an NOUN with relatively low NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is often VERB for minor pain , and it is available over - the - NOUN in some other countries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the act of focusing on a single target ( such as the NOUN or a repeated sound ) to increase awareness of the moment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while NOUN is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated , an individual can perform NOUN alone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of a given sensory system to the ADJ stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be VERB NUM % of the time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another way to think about this is by VERB how ADJ can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be VERB half of the time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while our sensory receptors are ADV VERB information from the environment , it is ultimately how we VERB that information that affects how we interact with the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perception refers to the way sensory information is organized , VERB , and ADV experienced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , we often do n’t VERB stimuli that remain relatively constant over ADJ periods of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as sensory NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> imagine entering a NOUN with an old ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have VERB effects on perception . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , marshall PROPN , donald PROPN , and PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) published the results of a ADJ study in which they demonstrated that individuals from western cultures were more ADJ to experience certain types of visual NOUN than individuals from non - western cultures , and vice ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM such NOUN that PROPN were more likely to experience was the PROPN - PROPN NOUN ( [ link ] ) : <sent_end> <sent_begin> the lines appear to be different NOUN , but they are actually the same length . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or NOUN ) to the lowest point on the wave ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> wavelength refers to the length of a wave from NUM peak to the next . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> like light waves , the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high - frequency sound waves are perceived as high - ADJ sounds , while low - frequency sound waves are perceived as low - VERB sounds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> light waves are transmitted across the NOUN and enter the eye through the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when light levels are high , the NOUN will VERB , or become smaller , to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN ’s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the PROPN , which is the colored portion of the eye . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN contains ADV VERB specialized NOUN cells ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN cells , known as cones , are light - VERB cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cones are specialized types of NOUN that work best in ADJ light conditions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and cones are connected ( via several NOUN ) to ADJ NOUN cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN from the ADJ NOUN cells VERB and exit through the back of the eye to form the ADJ nerve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> normal - ADJ individuals have NUM different types of cones that VERB color vision . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each of these NOUN types is ADV sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another NOUN is that this leads to the experience of negative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN describes the NOUN of a visual NOUN after removal of the stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , when you VERB ADV at the sun and then look away from it , you may still VERB a NOUN of light although the stimulus ( the sun ) has been removed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> their ADJ system consists of NUM NOUN connected to a highly ADJ NOUN system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cells in the NOUN are called NOUN cells ( or NOUN ) because they have a NOUN of NOUN that looks like a VERB NOUN when viewed under the microscope , as illustrated in [ PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB waste matter down the NOUN and out of the body through ADJ NOUN that open on the body surface ; NOUN also draw water from the ADJ fluid , allowing for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> animals that VERB ammonia are said to be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to VERB ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first NUM reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last NUM reactions occur in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN concentration in the blood , called blood NOUN nitrogen or NOUN , is used as an NOUN of kidney function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are NOUN , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a host is the organism that is VERB and often VERB by a pathogen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the innate immune system must respond ADV : by VERB the extracellular pathogen and/or by VERB host cells that have already been infected . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and NOUN detect the specific pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( NOUN ) on the pathogen ’s surface . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are NOUN , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ NOUN ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and NOUN but which differ from molecules on host cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first NOUN to be produced are ADJ - ADJ ; that is , they encourage NOUN , the VERB NOUN , NOUN , heat , and pain that result from the movement of NOUN and fluid through increasingly ADJ NOUN to a site of infection . the population of NOUN that VERB at an infection site depends on the nature of the VERB pathogen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN are particularly important NOUN that VERB large pathogens , such as bacteria and fungi . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN cell is a NOUN that produces ADJ molecules , such as NOUN , in response to large pathogens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a NOUN that , like a NOUN , releases chemicals to stimulate the ADJ response as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> lymphocytes are NOUN that are ADV ADJ by their large , ADV VERB nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> infected cells are identified and VERB by natural NOUN ( PROPN ) cells , lymphocytes that can VERB cells infected with viruses or NOUN cells ( ADJ cells that ADV divide and VERB other tissue ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> t cells and b cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ii molecules are found mainly on cells containing NOUN ( “ non - self proteins ” ) and on lymphocytes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ii molecules interact with NOUN t - cells to VERB the appropriate immune response , which may include the ADJ response . lymphocytes , such as PROPN cells , are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb PROPN NOUN and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN of approximately NUM types of ADJ proteins , called a NOUN system , functions to VERB extracellular pathogens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells of the liver and NOUN VERB NOUN proteins ADV ; these proteins are ADJ in the blood NOUN and are capable of VERB immediately to VERB microorganisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM types of adaptive responses : the cell - VERB immune response , which is carried out by t cells , and the ADJ immune response , which is controlled by activated b cells and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> activated t cells and b cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen VERB and attack the VERB pathogen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the PROPN , where they will serve as an NOUN to other immune cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( NOUN cells ) and the lining of the NOUN , lungs , stomach , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes a ADJ cell NOUN on the surface of other cells to VERB an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen - VERB cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ PROPN + cells bind NOUN via their antigen - embedded PROPN ii molecules and are stimulated to become NOUN t ( NOUN ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate b cells ( or ADJ t cells ) directly or secrete NOUN to VERB more and various target cells about the ADJ threat . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , PROPN + cells engage antigen - embedded PROPN i molecules on NOUN and are stimulated to become ADJ t lymphocytes ( NOUN ) , which directly VERB infected cells by NOUN and VERB NOUN to VERB the immune response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM populations of t cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind PROPN molecules via their antigen receptors called t cell receptors ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plasma cells and NOUN are collectively called ADJ cells : they represent ADJ NOUN of their ADJ NOUN , and they are involved in VERB about the immune defense of VERB pathogens and infected host cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> immune NOUN is crucial for VERB ADJ NOUN given the ADJ number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that NOUN of the ADJ cavity , NOUN , and ADJ ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> immune NOUN is brought about by specialized NOUN in the liver , NOUN nodes , small intestine , and lung that present ADJ NOUN to an ADV diverse population of regulatory t ( PROPN ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that VERB local NOUN and VERB the NOUN of ADJ immune factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the combined result of PROPN cells is to prevent ADJ NOUN and NOUN in ADJ tissue NOUN and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the majority of cells in the blood are NOUN ( red blood cells ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a ADJ fluid that VERB tissues and organs with ADJ white blood cells and does not contain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct ADJ and blood circulatory systems , which are separated by ADJ space , by a process called NOUN ( passing through to surrounding tissue ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> not all NOUN bind with the same strength , NOUN , and stability . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , NOUN exhibit different NOUN ( NOUN ) depending on the molecular NOUN between antigen and NOUN molecules , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN with a higher NOUN for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and ADV , and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen VERB to the specific antigen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once the ADJ NOUN are VERB , blood flow into the NOUN VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these hormones go NUM step further and VERB the NOUN - NOUN - NOUN system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN acts on PROPN , which is made in the liver and VERB it to NOUN PROPN NOUN VERB enzyme ( PROPN ) VERB NOUN i to PROPN ii . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ii VERB blood pressure by VERB blood vessels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) VERB blood pressure by acting as a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is released by cells in the NOUN of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> both methods have NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ reproduction produces offspring that are ADV identical to the parent because the offspring are all NOUN of the original parent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a single individual can produce offspring ADV and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is a form of ADJ reproduction that results from the NOUN of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into NUM individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs commonly in some ADJ animals such as NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN occurs in animals where NUM individual has both male and female reproductive parts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN such as NOUN , NOUN , NOUN and NOUN , shown in [ link ] , are often ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , VERB eggs are VERB in the female , but the embryo VERB its NOUN from the egg ’s NOUN and the young are fully developed when they are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this occurs in some bony fish ( like the NOUN PROPN NOUN ) , some NOUN , some NOUN , some NOUN ( such as the NOUN NOUN PROPN NOUN ) , some NOUN , and some ADJ animals ( like the PROPN VERB NOUN PROPN PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> vertebrates have similar structures , with a few differences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> non - mammals , such as birds and NOUN , have a common body opening , called a NOUN , for the digestive , ADJ and reproductive systems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB between birds usually involves VERB the NOUN NOUN opposite each other for transfer of sperm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sperm mature in ADJ NOUN that are VERB inside the NOUN , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the walls of the ADJ NOUN are made up of the developing sperm cells , with the least developed sperm at the NOUN of the NOUN and the fully developed sperm in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN , illustrated in [ link ] , is an organ that VERB NOUN from the renal bladder and functions as a ADJ organ during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN contains NUM tubes of NOUN tissue running through the length of the organ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN is a round , fatty area that VERB the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is a structure with NOUN tissue that contains a large number of sensory NOUN and serves as a source of NOUN during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN PROPN are a pair of ADJ NOUN of tissue that run posterior from the PROPN PROPN and VERB the other components of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> internal female reproductive structures include NOUN , NOUN , the NOUN , and the NOUN , shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the pair of NOUN is held in place in the ADJ cavity by a system of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the production of sperm is called NOUN and the production of eggs is called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the NOUN of NOUN , the hypothalamus causes the release of PROPN and PROPN into the male system for the first time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN enters the NOUN and stimulates the PROPN cells to begin VERB NOUN using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN also enters the NOUN and stimulates the ADJ cells of PROPN to make and release NOUN into the NOUN and the blood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ cycle VERB the NOUN of endocrine tissues and release of eggs , while the ADJ cycle VERB the NOUN and maintenance of the ADJ lining . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these cycles occur ADV and are VERB over a NUM day cycle , with an average length of NUM days . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to ensure that the offspring has only NUM complete diploid set of chromosomes , only NUM sperm must fuse with NUM egg . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of NOUN called the X NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a sperm binds to the X NOUN , a series of ADJ events , called the ADJ reactions , take place . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN can take place in NUM ways : PROPN ( total ) NOUN or ADJ ( partial ) NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the type of NOUN depends on the amount of NOUN in the eggs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during the first NUM to NUM weeks of the first NOUN , NOUN and waste are VERB by the ADJ lining through diffusion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the NOUN VERB , the outer layer of the embryo begins to VERB with the NOUN , and the NOUN forms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this organ takes over the NOUN and waste requirements of the embryo and NOUN , with the mother ’s blood passing nutrients to the NOUN and VERB waste from it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN leads to the formation of the NUM NOUN layers that give rise , during further development , to the different organs in the animal body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is characterized by rapid and ADJ movements of the cells within the embryo . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> all of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the ADJ realm ( or zone ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the NOUN to the ADJ parts of the ocean floor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> within the ADJ realm is the ADJ zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can VERB ( approximately NUM m or NUM NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ zone , which is the zone between high and low NOUN , is the ADJ region that is ADJ to land ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> generally , most people think of this portion of the ocean as a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> humans rely on ADJ NOUN to provide aquatic resources for NOUN water , NOUN NOUN , NOUN , and industry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN are found in terrestrial NOUN and are , therefore , connected with ADJ and ADJ factors VERB these terrestrial NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN ( the NOUN of the river or NOUN ) is ADJ than at any other place along the length of the river or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of this , the current is often ADJ here than at any other point of the river or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> climate refers to the long - term , predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the climate of a NOUN is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the variation in the sun ’s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ intensity is the amount of ADJ power or energy the sun VERB in a given amount of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a direct relationship between ADJ intensity and temperature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for ADJ organisms , such as mammals , birds , or fish , a technique called NOUN and NOUN is often used . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this method involves VERB a sample of VERB animals in some way ( such as NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , or other body NOUN ) , and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to VERB with the rest of the population ; later , a new sample is collected , including some individuals that are marked ( NOUN ) and some individuals that are ADJ ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another tool used by population NOUN is a NOUN curve , which is a graph of the number of individuals VERB at each age NOUN VERB versus time ( usually with data VERB from a life NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these curves allow us to compare the life NOUN of different populations ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after NUM day and NUM of these cycles , the population would have increased from NUM to more than NUM NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the population size , n , is VERB over time , a PROPN - shaped growth curve is produced ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited . <sent_end> <sent_begin> furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , VERB the growth rate . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> while some NOUN learn to avoid eating certain potential NOUN because of their NOUN , other species have evolved mechanisms to VERB this NOUN to avoid being VERB , even though they themselves may not be ADJ to eat or contain ADJ chemicals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ NOUN , a ADJ species VERB the NOUN NOUN of a ADJ one . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB they share the same NOUN , this NOUN then protects the ADJ ones , even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical NOUN against NOUN as the organism they VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all species have an ADJ NOUN in the ecosystem , which describes how they VERB the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the competitive NOUN principle states that NUM species can not VERB the same NOUN in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , different species can not VERB in a community if they are competing for all the same resources . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NUM goal of behavioral biology is to VERB out the innate behaviors , which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental NOUN , from the learned behaviors , which result from environmental conditioning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> innate behavior , or NOUN , is important because there is no risk of an ADJ behavior being learned . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a similar , but more VERB version of PROPN is NOUN : the VERB movement ADP or away from a stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this movement can be in response to light ( PROPN ) , chemical signals ( NOUN ) , or gravity ( PROPN ) and can be VERB toward ( positive ) or away ( negative ) from the source of the stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the act of VERB for and VERB food resources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB behaviors that VERB energy gain and VERB energy expenditure are called ADJ NOUN behaviors , and these are VERB by natural section . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> some NOUN , including humans , are able to learn by VERB the behavior of others and by taking NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning , the NOUN of information using the mind , the most prominent method of human learning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , that is how students are learning right now by reading this book . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , NOUN describes how many offspring could ADV be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible , VERB the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> additionally , populations do not usually exist in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they engage in ADJ competition : that is , they share the environment with other species , competing with them for the same resources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , r - selected species have a large number of small offspring ( hence their r NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this strategy is often employed in ADJ or changing environments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the scientific understanding of a food chain is more ADJ than in its everyday NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass : primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a single path through the chain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ consumers are NOUN that eat other NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> higher - level consumers VERB on the next lower NOUN levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the ADJ consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the lake PROPN food chain shown in [ link ] , the PROPN NOUN is the ADJ consumer at the top of this food chain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a VERB food web ( such as the lake PROPN food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by NOUN and various NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ food web consists of a base of organisms that VERB on VERB organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that VERB organic material back into the ADJ part of the ecosystem as they themselves are VERB by other organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple ADJ NOUN to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer NOUN to ADV model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances , and they can serve as a NOUN to ecosystem NOUN ( such as conservation NOUN or NOUN NOUN ) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the increasing concentration of ADJ , ADJ substances in organisms at each ADJ level , from the primary producers to the ADJ consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many substances have been shown to VERB , including classical studies with the NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) , which was published in the 1960s NOUN , PROPN spring , by PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as NOUN falls through this gas , it creates the phenomenon known as acid NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> acid NOUN is ADJ NOUN caused by NOUN falling to the ground through NOUN dioxide gas , VERB it into weak ADJ acid , which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> acid NOUN VERB the natural environment by VERB the PROPN of NOUN , which VERB many of the ADJ NOUN ; it also affects the man - made environment through the chemical NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN was introduced in NUM , but VERB low until the NUM when its populations began to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN population grew by VERB NOUN , driving species after species to the point of extinction ( the NOUN of a species ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , there were several factors that VERB a role in the extinction of perhaps NUM NOUN species in lake PROPN : the PROPN NOUN , VERB lake water quality due to NOUN and land VERB on the NOUN of lake PROPN , and increased NOUN pressure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is also useful to define ecosystem diversity , meaning the number of different ecosystems on the NOUN or in a given geographic area ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whole ecosystems can VERB even if some of the species might survive by VERB to other ecosystems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , british NOUN PROPN PROPN developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss : NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN are ADJ areas that contain high numbers of ADJ species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the purpose of the concept was to identify important NOUN on the NOUN for conservation efforts , a kind of conservation NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second approach to VERB present - time extinction rates is to VERB species loss with NOUN loss by measuring NOUN - area loss and understanding species - area relationships . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the species - area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area VERB is increased . <sent_end> <sent_begin> studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> view a brief NOUN VERB the role of marine ecosystems in supporting human welfare and the decline of ocean ecosystems . bush NOUN is the ADJ term used for wild animals killed for food . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is VERB throughout the world , but NOUN practices , particularly in ADJ africa and parts of asia , are believed to VERB several species with extinction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> early evidence suggests that another ADJ pathogen , PROPN NOUN , introduced from europe is responsible for white - NOUN syndrome , which VERB NOUN - VERB NOUN in ADJ north america and has spread from a point of origin in western new york state ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the disease has VERB NOUN populations and VERB extinction of species already listed as VERB : the PROPN NOUN , PROPN PROPN , and ADV the virginia big - ADJ NOUN , PROPN PROPN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during the middle PROPN , most PROPN lived in small NOUN that VERB of a ADJ house or NOUN for the PROPN , a church , and simple homes for the NOUN or NOUN , who made up about NUM percent of western europe ’s population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of these NOUN and ADJ cities remain all over europe ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the most ADV VERB ADJ ADJ cities is PROPN , france . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during this period , the PROPN church became the most powerful international organization in western europe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just as ADJ life VERB on the NOUN , NOUN and family life VERB around the church . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , or special NOUN of the church , marked every stage of life , from birth to NOUN , marriage , and NOUN , and brought people into the church on a ADJ basis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as PROPN spread throughout europe , it replaced ADJ and ADJ views , VERB ADJ events and forces of nature in its own terms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by the ADJ century , a major christian ADJ war called the PROPN , or NOUN , had begun to ADV push the PROPN from spain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between PROPN and PROPN for NOUN of the PROPN land ( the ADJ region of PROPN ) , known as the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN had no system of writing , however . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they VERB and VERB NOUN using a system of colored NOUN and NOUN called the PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV in the PROPN , a VERB demand for labor VERB PROPN because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going . <sent_end> <sent_begin> spain granted NOUN — legal rights to native labor — to NOUN who could VERB their service to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this system VERB the spanish view of NOUN : the king VERB successful NOUN who expanded the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the economic philosophy of NOUN shaped european perceptions of wealth from the NUM to the late NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN held that only a limited amount of wealth , as measured in gold and NOUN NOUN , existed in the world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as PROPN VERB the PROPN , they brought with them plants , animals , and diseases that changed lives and NOUN on both sides of the ocean . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NUM - way NOUN between the PROPN and europe / africa are known collectively as the PROPN exchange ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the NOUN , spain VERB PROPN as the dominant european power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this age of NOUN and the subsequent creation of an PROPN world marked the ADJ phase of globalization , in which previously VERB groups — PROPN , native americans , and PROPN — first came into contact with each other , sometimes with ADJ results . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> spain , with its new world wealth , was the NOUN of the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> beginning with the reform efforts of martin PROPN in NUM and john PROPN in the NOUN , however , ADJ NOUN came under attack as the PROPN PROPN , a split or NOUN among european PROPN , began . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , by the late NOUN , some english members of the church began to VERB for more reform . <sent_end> <sent_begin> known as PROPN , they worked to VERB all NOUN of PROPN from the church of england . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the time , the term “ PROPN ” was a ADJ NUM ; many people saw PROPN as ADJ - than - VERB NOUN who used religion to VERB their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by VERB to VERB along the NOUN on the banks of the PROPN , the english ADV placed themselves at the center of the PROPN PROPN , a powerful ADJ NOUN of NUM native groups with perhaps as many as NUM - NUM NUM people . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the territory of the equally ADJ PROPN people also VERB english NOUN at the north end of the PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of european goods gave rise to new ADJ objects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NOUN NOUN made the creation of shell NOUN among the native people of the PROPN PROPN much ADJ , and the result was an ADJ increase in the production of NOUN , shell NOUN used in NOUN and as NOUN and currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> native NOUN had always placed goods in the NOUN of their VERB , and this practice VERB with the NOUN of european goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN west PROPN company found the business of NOUN in new PROPN to be expensive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to share some of the costs , it granted ADJ NOUN who VERB ADV in it NOUN , or large NOUN of land and the right to govern the NOUN there . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in return , the NOUN who gained the NOUN VERB to pay for the passage of at least NUM ADJ farmers to VERB the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN revolution also led to the english PROPN act of NUM , a law passed by PROPN that allowed for greater religious diversity in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this act granted religious NOUN to ADJ ADJ PROPN ( those who believed in the PROPN PROPN of god the PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN PROPN ) , such as PROPN ( those who advocated adult NOUN ) and NOUN ( those who followed the PROPN ’ lead in creating independent NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the church of england remained the official state religious establishment , the PROPN act gave much greater religious freedom to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN were a ADJ society that advocated PROPN principles of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB in PROPN NOUN in the early ADJ century , and ADJ NOUN ( local units ) soon spread throughout europe and the british colonies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN was VERB , and england became a republic : a state without a king . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN VERB the new english PROPN , and the period known as the english NOUN , or the time between NOUN , began . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> creating wealth for the PROPN remained a primary goal , and in the second half of the ADJ century , especially during the PROPN , england attempted to gain better control of trade with the american colonies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ policies by which it tried to achieve this control are known as the PROPN acts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN paying the NOUN - man , or VERB and NOUN ( [ link ] ) , shows NUM NOUN VERB and VERB the PROPN of customs , john PROPN , a sea NOUN , army NOUN , and ADJ PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN shows the boston tea party , a protest against the tea act of NUM , and the liberty tree , an NOUN tree near boston common that became a NOUN point against the stamp act of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> prior to the NUM act , colonial NOUN of the PROPN acts had been tried in local courts , where sympathetic colonial NOUN refused to VERB NOUN on trial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the sugar act required NOUN to be tried in vice - NOUN courts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN - VERB NOUN , which VERB NOUN that occurred at sea , VERB without NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , the british PROPN moved beyond the efforts during the previous NUM years to better regulate NOUN expansion and trade by VERB in place the stamp act . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a direct tax on the colonists , the stamp act imposed an internal tax on almost every type of VERB paper colonists used , including newspapers , legal documents , and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the NOUN of the stamp act saw the measure as a way to VERB the costs of the british PROPN , it ADV gave rise to the first major colonial protest against british ADJ control as expressed in the famous NOUN “ no NOUN without representation . ” the stamp act VERB the sense among some colonists that PROPN was not VERB them as NOUN of their NOUN across the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , PROPN was old and ADJ with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his NOUN of the NOUN , charles PROPN ( [ link ] ) , whose job was to VERB the NOUN ’s NOUN , took on many of his NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> primary among these was raising the needed revenue from the colonies . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> he argued for the creation of an american republic , a state without a king , and VERB the NOUN of NOUN , a political philosophy that held that elected representatives , not a ADJ NOUN , should govern states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the vision of an american republic put forward by PROPN included the idea of popular NOUN : citizens in the republic would determine who would represent them , and decide other issues , on the basis of majority rule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN also served as a social philosophy VERB the conduct of the PROPN in their NOUN against the british PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the southern colonies soon became the center of the fighting . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the southern strategy brought the british success at first , but NOUN to the leadership of george washington and general PROPN PROPN and the crucial assistance of french forces , the PROPN army VERB the british at PROPN , effectively VERB further large - scale NOUN during the war . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> whereas the british could pay in gold and NOUN , the american forces VERB on paper money , VERB by loans obtained in europe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this first american money was called ADJ currency ; ADV , it quickly VERB in value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ not worth a PROPN ” soon became a NOUN term for something of no value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to many NOUN , especially wealthy NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN , democracy did not offer a good NOUN for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , conservative PROPN defined themselves in opposition to democracy , which they VERB with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN in a series of NOUN later known as the federalist papers , PROPN james madison wrote : “ NOUN have ever been NOUN of NOUN and NOUN ; have ever been found ADJ with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> many shared this perspective and worked hard to keep democratic NOUN in check . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while racial thinking VERB the new country , and slavery existed in all the new states , the NOUN of the revolution generated a movement toward the NOUN of slavery . <sent_end> <sent_begin> private NOUN , by which NOUN freed their slaves , provided NUM pathway from NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN in virginia freed some NUM NUM slaves . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> although displacement is described in terms of direction , distance is not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between NUM positions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that the distance between NUM positions is not the same as the distance VERB between them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ motion is the motion of an object VERB or VERB into the air , subject to only the acceleration of gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the object is called a NOUN , and its path is called its NOUN . the motion of falling objects , as covered in problem - solving PROPN for NUM - dimensional PROPN , is a simple NUM - dimensional type of NOUN motion in which there is no horizontal movement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to understand this , we need a working definition of force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> section PROPN <sent_end> <sent_begin> dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> external forces are any outside forces that act on a body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a free - body diagram is a NOUN of all external forces acting on a body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what do we mean by an external force ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ NOUN of external is correct — an external force acts from outside the system of interest . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in [ link ] ( a ) the system of interest is the NOUN plus the child in it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> numerous common experiences , such as VERB a NOUN or VERB a ball , VERB this . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is ADV stated in newton ’s third law of motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> newton ’s third law of motion <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a reaction force that VERB a body forward in response to a ADJ force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , and cars are pushed forward by a ADJ reaction force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in earth ’s frame this looks like a NOUN force on the NOUN , or it can be VERB as a NOUN of newton ’s first law ( the law of NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ frame of reference is NUM in which all forces are real and , ADV , NUM in which newton ’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter . earth ’s rotation is slow enough that earth is nearly an ADJ frame . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you ADV must perform ADJ experiments to VERB ADJ forces and the ADJ NOUN from newton ’s laws , such as the effect just described . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a NOUN VERB a car into a wall , the car will not move but it will ADV change shape . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a change in shape due to the application of a force is a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even very small forces are known to cause some NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> { } recall that the direction of PROPN size PROPN rsub { size NUM { c } } } { } is toward the center . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you may use DET expression is more ADJ , as illustrated in examples below . a NOUN ( see [ link ] b ) is a VERB device used to separate NOUN of different NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high ADJ acceleration significantly decreases the time it takes for separation to occur , and makes separation possible with small NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let us now consider ADJ curves , where the slope of the NOUN helps you VERB the curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> see [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units , which are VERB values . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the length of a race , which is a physical quantity , can be expressed in units of NOUN ( for NOUN ) or NOUN ( for distance NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( note that electric current will not be introduced until much later in this NOUN . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> all other physical quantities , such as force and electric charge , can be expressed as ADJ NOUN of length , mass , time , and current ( for example , speed is length divided by time ) ; these units are called derived units . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN unit for mass is the NOUN ( VERB NOUN ) ; it is defined to be the mass of a NOUN - NOUN NOUN VERB with the old NOUN standard at the international bureau of PROPN and measures near PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN of the standard NOUN are also VERB at the united states ’ national institute of standards and technology , or PROPN , located in PROPN , PROPN outside of washington PROPN , and at other NOUN around the world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> next , we need to determine a NOUN factor VERB NOUN to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN factor is a ratio VERB how many of NUM unit are equal to another unit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , models can help NOUN VERB a NOUN and perform a NOUN , or they can be used to represent a situation in the form of a computer NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and VERB multiple times by various groups of researchers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some theories include models to help VERB phenomena , whereas others do not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( see [ link ] , [ link ] , and [ link ] . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> physics as it developed from the PROPN to the end of the ADJ century is called classical physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it was transformed into modern physics by revolutionary NOUN made starting at the beginning of the ADJ century . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> relativity must be used ADV an object is VERB at greater than about NUM % of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the sun . <sent_end> <sent_begin> quantum NOUN must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the combination of these NUM theories is ADJ quantum NOUN , and it describes the behavior of small objects VERB at high NOUN or VERB a strong gravitational field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ speed is the magnitude of ADJ velocity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , VERB the NOUN NOUN at NUM NOUN had an ADJ velocity of PROPN m / s ( the minus meaning toward the NOUN of the plane ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN in a car can in fact cause it to speed up . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the greater the acceleration , the greater the change in velocity over a given time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these NOUN , but more ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> air resistance VERB the motion of an object through the air , while friction between objects — such as between NOUN and a ADJ NOUN or between a NOUN and a NOUN into which it is VERB — also VERB motion between them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for the ideal situations of these first few NOUN , an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free - fall . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fact that the straight - line distance ( NUM blocks ) in [ link ] is less than the total distance VERB ( NUM blocks ) is NUM example of a general characteristic of vectors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( recall that vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the degree of NOUN and NOUN of a measuring system are related to the NOUN in the measurements . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a ADJ measure of how much your measured values VERB from a standard or expected value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on many NOUN , NOUN , other scientists , and NOUN need to make NOUN or “ NOUN ” for a particular quantity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is the distance to a certain NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN used to represent a vector has a length proportional to the vector ’s magnitude ( e.g. , the larger the magnitude , the longer the length of the vector ) and points in the same direction as the vector . some physical quantities , like distance , either have no direction or NOUN is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is any quantity that has a magnitude , but no direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NUM temperature , the NUM NOUN ( NUM NOUN ) of energy in a NOUN bar , a NUM NOUN / h speed limit , a person ’s NUM m height , and a distance of NUM m are all NOUN — quantities with no ADJ direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the head - to - tail method is a ADJ way to add vectors , described in [ link ] below and in the steps following . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector , and the head ( or NOUN ) of a vector is the final , ADJ end of the NOUN . head - to - tail method : the head - to - tail method of ADV adding vectors is illustrated for the NUM NOUN of the person VERB in a city considered in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) draw a vector representing the displacement to the east . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ) step NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to get the direction of the NOUN , measure the angle it makes with the reference frame using a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( note that in most NOUN , we will use ADJ relationships to determine this angle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we will need to take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in most cases , this involves determining the ADJ components of a single vector , for example the x - and y - components , or the north - south and east - west components . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the study of motion is NOUN , but NOUN only describes the way objects move — their velocity and their acceleration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dynamics VERB the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> newton ’s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> newton ’s first law is often called the law of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN of NUM substance is equal in mass to a NOUN of another substance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the quantities that might differ between them are volume and density . <sent_end> <sent_begin> section PROPN <sent_end> <sent_begin> newton ’s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest , or , if in motion , remains in motion at a constant velocity unless VERB on by a net external force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is also known as the law of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mass is the quantity of matter in a substance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is more ADJ ADV to think of something physical actually moving between objects acting at a distance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] VERB the exchange or carrier particles , both observed and proposed , that carry the NUM forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but the real fruit of the particle - exchange proposal is that NOUN for PROPN ’s proposed particle found it and a number of others that were completely ADJ , stimulating yet more research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , friction VERB a NOUN NOUN VERB on NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but when objects are ADJ , ADJ friction can act between them ; the ADJ friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> kinetic friction <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from the definition of work , we see that those units are force times distance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , in PROPN units , work and energy are measured in newton - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a newton - PROPN is given the special name PROPN ( PROPN ) , and NUM PROPN = NUM n NOUN m = NUM NOUN PROPN m2 / s NUM PROPN = NUM n NOUN m = NUM NOUN PROPN m2 / PROPN size NUM { NUM " PROPN " = NUM " n " NOUN m = NUM " NOUN " NOUN m rsup { size NUM { NUM } } " / s " rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> potential energy can be stored in any elastic NOUN by VERB it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , the general definition of potential energy is energy due to position , shape , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for shape or position NOUN , stored energy is PROPN = NUM k x NUM PROPN s = NUM k x NUM size NUM { " PROPN " rsub { size NUM { s } } = { { NUM } over { NUM } } ital " PROPN " r PROPN { size NUM { NUM } } } { } , where PROPN size NUM { k } { } is the force constant of the particular system and NOUN size NUM { x } { } is its NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , such as gasoline and food , carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chemical NOUN can also produce electrical energy , such as in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this internal mechanical energy from the random NOUN is called thermal energy , because it is related to the temperature of the object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> work done by a person is sometimes called useful work , which is work done on the outside world , such as VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> useful work requires a force VERB through a distance on the outside world , and so it VERB internal work , such as that done by the heart when VERB blood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people ’s ADJ understanding of momentum : a large , ADV - moving object has greater momentum than a smaller , ADJ object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> linear momentum is defined as the product of a system ’s mass VERB by its velocity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , linear momentum is expressed as <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it can be similarly shown that total momentum is VERB for any ADJ system , with any number of objects in it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in equation form , the conservation of momentum principle for an ADJ system is written <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an elastic NOUN is one that also VERB internal kinetic energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic NOUN of the objects in the system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates an elastic NOUN in which internal kinetic energy and momentum are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV elastic NOUN can only be achieved with ADJ particles , such as electrons VERB nuclei . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we have seen that in an elastic NOUN , internal kinetic energy is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an inelastic NOUN is NUM in which the internal kinetic energy changes ( it is not VERB ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this lack of conservation means that the forces between VERB objects may remove or add internal kinetic energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the magnitude , direction , and point of application of the force are VERB into the definition of the physical quantity called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the ADJ NOUN of a force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a measure of the NOUN of a force in changing or VERB a rotation ( changing the ADJ velocity over a period of time ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a system is in neutral equilibrium if its equilibrium is independent of NOUN from its original position . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN on a flat horizontal surface is an example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we note that a = NOUN = NOUN size NUM { a = r α } { } , and we VERB this expression into f = PROPN f = PROPN size NUM { f = ital " PROPN " } { } , VERB f = NOUN . f = PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { f = ital " PROPN " α " . " } <sent_end> <sent_begin> { } <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that NOUN is the VERB NOUN of a force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , because PROPN size NUM { " f " } { } is ADJ to NOUN size NUM { r } { } , NOUN is simply NOUN = NOUN = NOUN size NUM { NOUN = NOUN } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this equation is the work - energy NOUN for ADJ motion only . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you may recall , net work changes the kinetic energy of a system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the major distinction is that gases are easily VERB , whereas NOUN are not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we shall generally refer to both gases and NOUN simply as fluids , and make a distinction between them only when they behave differently . PROPN PROPN : states of matter — NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> pressure is defined as force per unit area . <sent_end> <sent_begin> can pressure be increased in a fluid by VERB directly on the fluid ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the person making the measurement then ADV VERB the applied pressure and VERB for blood flow to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> blood pressure VERB because of the VERB action of the heart , reaching a maximum , called ADJ pressure , and a minimum , called ADJ pressure , with each NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ pressure is measured by VERB the value of NOUN size NOUN } { } when blood flow first begins as NOUN pressure is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is done by measuring the NOUN of a VERB object that is VERB — for example , with a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is useful to define the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid ( usually water ) as specific gravity : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the ADJ possible surface area . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this general effect is called surface tension . <sent_end> <sent_begin> molecules on the surface are VERB ADV by ADJ forces , reducing the surface area . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this change produces no ADJ effects and , in fact , may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ pressure can be an NOUN of fluid balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when low , it may indicate that a person is VERB ADV and needs a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> bladder pressure VERB ADV from NUM to about NUM NOUN PROPN as the bladder VERB to its normal capacity of NUM NOUN NUM NOUN size NUM { " NUM " ` " NOUN " rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pressure triggers the NOUN NOUN , which stimulates the NOUN of VERB to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is more , it also causes muscles around the bladder to contract , raising the pressure to over NUM NOUN PROPN , VERB the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> situations in which fluid flows at a constant depth are so important that this equation is often called PROPN ’s principle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is PROPN ’s equation for fluids at constant depth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this equation is called PROPN ’s law for resistance after the french scientist PROPN PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , who derived it in an attempt to understand the flow of blood , an often ADJ fluid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an interesting NOUN of the increase in PROPN size NUM { f rsub { size NUM { v } } } { } with speed is that an object falling through a fluid will not continue to VERB ADV ( as it would if we VERB air resistance , for example ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , ADJ NOUN increases , VERB acceleration , until a critical speed , called the ADJ speed , is reached and the acceleration of the object becomes NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once this happens , the object continues to fall at constant speed ( the ADJ speed ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the transport of water through a ADJ membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is driven by the NOUN in water concentration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is not reverse NOUN , because there is no back pressure to cause it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is VERB is called active transport , a process in which a living membrane VERB energy to move substances across it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many living membranes move water and other substances by active transport . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> only NUM PROPN NOUN VERB the same range as NUM PROPN NOUN , thus NUM degree on the PROPN scale is NUM times larger than NUM degree on the PROPN scale NUM / NUM = NUM / NUM . NUM / NUM = NUM / NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { " NUM " / " NUM " = NUM / NUM " . " <sent_end> <sent_begin> } { } the PROPN scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is an absolute temperature scale defined to have 0 k at the lowest possible temperature , called absolute NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , NOUN has shown that if NUM systems , a and b , are in thermal equilibrium with each another , and b is in thermal equilibrium with a third system c , then a is also in thermal equilibrium with c . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN may seem obvious , because all NUM have the same temperature , but it is basic to thermodynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is called the ADJ law of thermodynamics . the PROPN law of thermodynamics <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ideal gas law states that <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at lower temperatures , the curves begin to look less like NOUN — the gas is not VERB ADV and may even contain liquid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a critical point — that is , a critical temperature — above which liquid can not exist . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at ADV high pressure above the critical point , the gas will have the density of a liquid but will not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all NUM curves on the phase diagram meet at a single point , the ADJ point , where all NUM phases exist in equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for water , the ADJ point occurs at NUM k ( NUM NOUN c ) ( NUM NOUN c ) size NUM { NOUN ( NUM " . " <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a mixture of gases , the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases , VERB ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this law is known as PROPN ’s law of partial pressures , after the english scientist john PROPN ( NUM ) , who proposed it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s law is based on kinetic theory , where each gas creates its pressure by molecular NOUN , independent of other gases present . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , relative NOUN rises in the NOUN , as air temperature NOUN , sometimes reaching the NOUN point . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the NOUN point temperature , relative NOUN is NUM % , and NOUN may result from the NOUN of water NOUN if they are small enough to VERB in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this NOUN helped establish the fact that heat is a form of energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> james PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) performed many experiments to establish the mechanical NOUN of heat — the work needed to produce the same effects as heat transfer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in terms of the units used for these NUM terms , the best modern value for this NOUN is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the heat transfer by the ADJ movement of a fluid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of transfer takes place in a forced - air NOUN and in NOUN systems , for example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the rate of heat transfer by ADJ radiation is determined by the PROPN - PROPN law of radiation : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> human metabolism is the NOUN of food into heat transfer , work , and stored fat . <sent_end> <sent_begin> metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the area under the curve in that case is negative , because PROPN size NUM } { } is negative . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN size NUM { ital " PROPN " } { } NOUN clearly VERB that the work done depends on the path taken and not just the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this path NOUN is seen in [ link ] ( a ) , where more work is done in going from a to c by the path via point b than by the path via point d. the vertical NOUN , where volume is constant , are called PROPN processes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since volume is constant , PROPN v = NUM NOUN v = NUM size NUM { NOUN v = NUM } { } , and no work is done in an NOUN process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although NOUN is seen in day - to - day life — a broken glass does not VERB its original state , for instance — complete NOUN is a statistical statement that can not be seen during the lifetime of the universe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more ADV , an ADJ process is one that depends on path . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the process can go in only NUM direction , then the reverse path VERB ADV and the process can not be ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second law of thermodynamics ( second expression ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is impossible in any system for heat transfer from a NOUN to completely convert to work in a ADJ process in which the system returns to its initial state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ process VERB a system , such as the gas in a NOUN , back to its original state at the end of every cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most heat NOUN , such as VERB NOUN NOUN and VERB NOUN , use ADJ processes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second law of thermodynamics can be VERB in terms of the PROPN cycle , and so what PROPN actually discovered was this fundamental law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> any heat NOUN VERB the PROPN cycle is called a PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is crucial to the PROPN cycle — and , in fact , VERB it — is that only ADJ processes are used . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ processes involve ADJ factors , such as friction and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with respect to NOUN , there are only NUM NOUN : NOUN is constant for a ADJ process , and it increases for an ADJ process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a fourth version of the second law of thermodynamics stated in terms of NOUN : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let us now imagine VERB this approach to perhaps a small sample of gas . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because VERB NOUN and PROPN involves statistics , this is called statistical analysis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a gas correspond to its ADJ properties , such as volume , temperature , and pressure ; and its NOUN correspond to the detailed NOUN of the positions and NOUN of its atoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> consider , for example , VERB a ADJ NOUN to the left as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the NOUN creates a force in the opposite direction , known as a VERB force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once released , the VERB force causes the NOUN to move back toward its stable equilibrium position , where the net force on it is NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for small NOUN , a NOUN is a simple ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a simple NOUN is defined to have an object that has a small mass , also known as the NOUN PROPN , which is VERB from a light NOUN or NOUN , such as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB the simple NOUN a NOUN further , we can VERB the conditions under which it VERB simple ADJ motion , and we can VERB an interesting expression for its period . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such a system is ADJ ; its displacement is represented by the curve in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> curve b in [ link ] represents an PROPN system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as with critical NOUN , it too may VERB the equilibrium position , but will reach equilibrium over a longer period of time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the driving frequency VERB ADV higher than the ADJ or natural frequency , the amplitude of the NOUN becomes smaller , until the NOUN nearly VERB and your NOUN simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the wave in [ link ] VERB in the horizontal direction while the surface is VERB in the vertical direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such a wave is called a ADJ wave or NOUN wave ; in such a wave , the disturbance is ADJ to the direction of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , in a ADJ wave or ADJ wave , the disturbance is parallel to the direction of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of the NUM waves are ADV aligned , as are the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN produces ADJ ADJ interference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the disturbances add , ADJ ADJ interference produces a wave that has DET the amplitude of the individual waves , but has the same wavelength . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] and [ link ] show NUM standing waves that can be created on a NOUN that is fixed at both ends . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nodes are the points where the NOUN does not move ; more generally , nodes are where the wave disturbance is NUM in a standing wave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fixed ends of NOUN must be nodes , too , because the NOUN can not move there . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the wave resulting from the NOUN of NUM similar - frequency waves has a frequency that is the average of the NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this wave VERB in amplitude , or NOUN , with a frequency called the NOUN frequency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can determine the NOUN frequency by adding NUM waves together ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you can also directly sense the frequency of a sound . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perception of frequency is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the wavelength of sound is not directly VERB , but ADJ evidence is found in the correlation of the size of ADJ NOUN with their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the lack of contrast makes image interpretation very difficult . <sent_end> <sent_begin> contrast is the difference in intensity between objects and the NOUN on which they are observed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( such as NOUN , NOUN , X . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a polarization microscope also VERB contrast by VERB a wave characteristic of light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> polarization NOUN are useful for objects that are ADV active or ADJ , particularly if those characteristics vary from place to place in the object . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement ( an PROPN ) at the open end , where motion is ADJ , and no displacement ( a NOUN ) at the closed end , where air movement is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the distance from a NOUN to an PROPN is NUM - fourth of a wavelength , and this VERB the length of the tube ; thus , λ = NUM l λ = NUM l size NUM { λ = NUM l } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> hearing is the perception of sound . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( perception is commonly defined to be awareness through the senses , a typically circular definition of higher - level processes in living organisms . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN perception is directly related to frequency and is not greatly affected by other physical quantities such as intensity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are particular sounds that can be produced by most NOUN and in western music have particular names . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of NOUN VERB music . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is true for other perceptions of sound , such as music and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we shall not VERB further into them ; rather , we will VERB on the question of NOUN perception . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a unit called a NOUN is used to express NOUN ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN differ from NOUN because the PROPN is a unit of NOUN perception , whereas the NOUN is a unit of physical intensity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> atomic and molecular interactions , such as the forces of friction , NOUN , and NOUN , are now known to be NOUN of the electromagnetic force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is just NUM aspect of the electromagnetic force , which also includes moving NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today we have the advantage of VERB that normal matter is made of atoms , and that atoms contain positive and negative charges , usually in equal amounts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons VERB its positive nucleus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nucleus is positive due to the presence of ADV charged protons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nearly all charge in nature is due to electrons and protons , which are NUM of the NUM building blocks of most matter . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively ADV through it is called a conductor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the moving electrons may VERB with fixed atoms and molecules , VERB some energy , but they can move in a conductor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is not necessary to transfer excess charge directly to an object in order to charge it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a method of NOUN ADV a charge is created in a ADJ object , without direct contact . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here we see NUM neutral NOUN NOUN in contact with NUM another but VERB from the rest of the world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> through the work of scientists in the late ADJ century , the main features of the ADJ force — the existence of NUM types of charge , the observation that like charges VERB , unlike charges attract , and the decrease of force with distance — were eventually VERB , and expressed as a ADJ formula . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ formula for the ADJ force is called PROPN ’s law after the french NOUN charles PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , who performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since the electric field has both magnitude and direction , it is a vector . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like all vectors , the electric field can be represented by an NOUN that has length proportional to its magnitude and that points in the correct direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( we have used NOUN ADV to represent force vectors , for example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN contain free charges that move easily . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when excess charge is placed on a conductor or the conductor is put into a ADJ electric field , charges in the conductor quickly respond to reach a ADJ state called ADJ equilibrium . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what causes the electric field ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> at around NUM NOUN above the surface of earth we have a layer of charged particles , called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is responsible for a range of phenomena including the electric field surrounding earth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the ADJ scale , it is more ADJ to define an energy unit called the electron NOUN ( NOUN ) , which is the energy given to a fundamental charge VERB through a potential difference of NUM v. <sent_end> <sent_begin> in equation form , <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most VERB NOUN use an ADJ process called NOUN — a word VERB from the greek words NOUN for ADJ and PROPN for writing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the heart of the process is shown in VERB form in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN - VERB NOUN NOUN is VERB with positive charge from points on a device called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN use the ADJ process to make high - quality images on paper , VERB a NOUN to produce an image on the PROPN NOUN as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in its most common application , the NOUN NOUN receives output from a computer , and it can achieve high - quality output because of the NOUN with which NOUN light can be controlled . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while we use blue NOUN to represent the magnitude and direction of the electric field , we use green lines to represent places where the electric potential is constant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are called ADJ lines in NUM NOUN , or ADJ surfaces in NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term ADJ is also used as a NOUN , VERB to an ADJ line or surface . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a system composed of NUM identical , parallel conducting NOUN separated by a distance , as in [ link ] , is called a parallel NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is easy to see the relationship between the voltage and the stored charge for a parallel NOUN NOUN , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN unit for current is the ADJ ( a ) , named for the french NOUN PROPN - PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since i = PROPN / PROPN i = PROPN / PROPN size NUM { i = PROPN / PROPN } { } , we see that an NOUN is NUM NOUN per second : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once the current is established , it is thus also a constant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> direct current ( dc ) is the flow of electric charge in only NUM direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is the ADJ state of a constant - voltage circuit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM known NOUN of NOUN — thermal and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a thermal NOUN is NUM where excessive electric power causes ADJ thermal effects , such as starting a fire in the wall of a house . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN occurs when electric current passes through a person . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the interior of the body has a much lower resistance than ADJ skin because of all the ADJ NOUN and fluids it contains . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if skin resistance is VERB , such as by an ADJ NOUN , a NOUN , or exposed NOUN leads , a person is VERB NOUN sensitive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this condition , NOUN about NUM / NUM those listed in [ link ] produce similar effects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as discussed in molecular transport phenomena : diffusion , PROPN , and related processes , free ions will VERB from a region of high concentration to NUM of low concentration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but the cell membrane is ADJ , meaning that some ions may cross it while others can not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in its VERB state , the cell membrane is ADJ to PROPN PROPN size NUM { " k " rsup { size NUM { + { } } } } { } and PROPN - PROPN size NUM { " PROPN " rsup { size NUM { + - { } } } } { } , and ADJ to NOUN NOUN size NUM { " NOUN " rsup { size NUM { + { } } } } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN have more than NUM component , called a NOUN that limits the flow of charge in the circuit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a measure of this limit on charge flow is called resistance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN of NOUN are the series and parallel connections illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows NOUN in parallel , VERB to a voltage source . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are in parallel when each NOUN is connected directly to the voltage source by VERB NOUN having ADJ resistance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the small scale , the potential difference creates an electric field that VERB force on charges , causing current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we thus use the name ADJ force , VERB emf . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s rules for circuit analysis are NOUN of conservation laws to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first rule is the application of conservation of charge , while the second rule is the application of conservation of energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN measure voltage , whereas NOUN measure current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of the NOUN in NOUN NOUN , ADJ NOUN , cell NOUN , and NOUN - NOUN are NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN draw some extra current , whereas NOUN reduce current flow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ measurements balance NOUN so that there is no current VERB through the measuring device and , therefore , no NOUN of the circuit being measured . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN is a ADJ measurement device for VERB resistance by VERB potential NOUN in a circuit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects , which are ADJ only with sensitive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> not only do ADJ materials respond strongly to NOUN ( the way NOUN is VERB to NOUN ) , they can also be VERB themselves — that is , they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ piece of NOUN is placed between NUM NOUN , ADJ , and then VERB , or simply VERB when cold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN becomes a permanent NOUN with the NOUN aligned as shown : its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original NOUN , and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this was the first significant evidence that the movement of charges had any connection with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the use of electric current to make NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADV induced NOUN are called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> his ability to think deeply and clearly about action at a distance , particularly for gravitational , electric , and magnetic forces , later VERB him to create his revolutionary theory of relativity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since magnetic forces act at a distance , we define a magnetic field to represent magnetic forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in VERB the strength and direction of the magnetic field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] , the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a NOUN NOUN points . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the magnetic field is traditionally called the b - field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> magnetic field lines are defined to have the direction that a small NOUN points when placed at a location . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) if small NOUN are used to map the magnetic field around a bar NOUN , they will point in the directions shown : away from the north pole of the NOUN , toward the south pole of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , such as those in ADJ NOUN NOUN on a car , are another common application of magnetic NOUN on a current - carrying loop . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows that a NOUN is very similar in construction to a motor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the magnetic field of a long straight NOUN has more NOUN than you might at first NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each segment of current produces a magnetic field like that of a long straight NOUN , and the total field of any shape current is the vector sum of the fields due to each segment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the formal statement of the direction and magnitude of the field due to each segment is called the PROPN - PROPN law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> integral NOUN is needed to sum the field for an ADJ shape current . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN can be used to give the direction of the field near the loop , but mapping with NOUN and the rules about field lines given in magnetic fields and magnetic field lines are needed for more detail . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a simple formula for the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> magnetic NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) is NUM of the most useful and rapidly growing medical NOUN tools . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it non - ADV produces NUM - dimensional and NUM - dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with NOUN of the NOUN of x - rays . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , some NUM years after PROPN ’s discovery , the english scientist michael PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) and the american scientist PROPN henry ( NUM – NUM ) ADV demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the basic process of VERB NOUN ( ADJ force ) and , hence , NOUN with magnetic fields is known as NOUN ; this process is also called magnetic NOUN to distinguish it from VERB by NOUN , which VERB the PROPN force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today , NOUN induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN — found in NOUN , on NOUN , in nuclear power plants , and so on — uses NOUN to generate current . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most of us have seen NOUN in which medical NOUN use a NOUN to pass an electric current through a patient ’s heart to get it to VERB normally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( review [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN do what their name implies — they VERB NOUN from NUM value to another ( the term voltage is used rather than emf , because NOUN have internal resistance ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , many cell NOUN , NOUN , NOUN NOUN , and power tools and small NOUN have a NOUN built into their NOUN - in unit ( like that in [ link ] ) that changes NUM v or NUM v NOUN into DET voltage the device uses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN has NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a thermal NOUN occurs when there is electrical VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN occurs when electric current passes through a person . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> is there a useful physical quantity related to how “ effective ” a given device is ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the answer is INTJ , and that physical quantity is called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a device that VERB significant self - NOUN is called an NOUN , and given the NOUN in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , charges VERB ADV they are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but while a current in a circuit needs a complete path , an NOUN has a varying charge distribution forming a standing wave , driven by the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the NOUN are critical for determining the frequency of the ADJ electromagnetic waves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> extremely low frequency ( PROPN ) radio waves of about NUM PROPN are used to communicate with VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ability of radio waves to VERB NOUN water is related to their wavelength ( much like NOUN VERB tissue ) — the longer the wavelength , the ADV they VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN radio waves are also used for commercial radio transmission , but in the frequency range of NUM to NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB for frequency NOUN , another method of carrying information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN channels are called PROPN ( for very high frequency ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other channels called PROPN ( for ADJ high frequency ) VERB an even higher frequency range of NUM to NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN means “ above NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the electromagnetic frequencies of ADJ radiation ( PROPN ) extend upward from NOUN , the highest - frequency visible light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is also produced by atomic and molecular NOUN and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> electromagnetic waves can bring energy into a system by NOUN of their electric and magnetic fields . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these fields can VERB forces and move charges in the system and , thus , do work on them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since light moves in straight lines , changing directions when it VERB with materials , it is described by NOUN and simple NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this part of NOUN , where the ray aspect of light NOUN , is therefore called ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM laws that govern how light changes direction when it VERB with matter . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of fibers can be used to VERB an image without a lens , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the output of a device called an NOUN is shown in [ link ] ( b ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are used to explore the body through various NOUN or minor NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ray NOUN is the technique of determining or following ( VERB ) the NOUN that light rays take . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for rays passing through matter , the law of NOUN is used to VERB the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the image is on the same side of the lens as the object and is ADV away from the lens than the object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this image , like all case NUM images , can not be VERB and , hence , is called a ADJ image . <sent_end> <sent_begin> light rays only appear to VERB at a ADJ image ; they do not actually pass through that location in space . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates NUM common vision NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , or NOUN , is the inability to see ADJ objects clearly while close objects are clear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the eye VERB the nearly parallel rays from a ADJ object , and the rays cross in front of the retina . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the eye - brain color - VERB system can , by VERB various objects in its view , VERB the true color of an object under varying NOUN conditions — an ability that is called color NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can sense that a white NOUN , for example , is white whether it is VERB by sunlight , ADJ light , or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN were first developed in the early NOUN by NOUN NOUN in the PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ compound microscope is VERB from NUM ADJ NOUN as shown ADV in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first lens is called the ADJ lens , and has typical NOUN values from NUM NUM to NUM NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ scientist PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> starting from some known position , PROPN ’s principle states that : every point on a NOUN is a source of NOUN that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the new NOUN is a line ADJ to all of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by ADJ , we mean waves are in phase or have a ADJ phase relationship . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ means the waves have random phase relationships . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why did young then pass the light through a double NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the accepted NOUN for determining the NOUN limit to resolution based on this angle was developed by PROPN PROPN in the ADJ century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN for the NOUN limit to resolution states that NUM images are just ADJ when the center of the NOUN pattern of NUM is directly over the first minimum of the NOUN pattern of the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> see [ link ] ( b ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( this is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> waves having such a direction are said to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for an PROPN wave , we define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN in NUM NOUN are in a vertical plane and are said to be ADV VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those in the other NOUN are in a horizontal plane and are ADV VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a vertical NOUN is placed on the first NOUN , the waves pass through . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> einstein essentially did the ADJ aspect of this method for relativity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with NUM ADV simple NOUN and a ADJ NOUN of how measurements are made , he produced the theory of special relativity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> einstein ’s first PROPN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ is the case . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the correct formula for NUM - dimensional ADJ velocity addition is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ kinetic energy is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> einstein VERB that there were several characteristics of the ADJ effect that could be explained only if PROPN radiation is itself VERB : the ADV continuous NOUN of energy in an PROPN wave is actually composed of energy PROPN called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in his explanation of the ADJ effect , einstein defined a VERB unit or quantum of PROPN energy , which we now call a photon , with an energy proportional to the frequency of PROPN radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in equation form , the photon energy PROPN = NOUN , e = NOUN , size NUM { e = ital " NOUN " } { } where PROPN size NUM { e } { } is the energy of a photon of frequency NOUN size NUM { f } { } and NOUN size NUM { h } { } is PROPN ’s constant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ radiation ( PROPN ) has even lower photon NOUN than visible light and can not significantly alter atoms and molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN can be absorbed and VERB by atoms and molecules , particularly between closely ADJ states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is also no NOUN that it VERB as particles — NOUN with ADJ energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we call this ADJ nature the particle - wave NOUN , meaning that PROPN radiation has both particle and wave properties . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this so - called NOUN is simply a term for properties of the photon ADJ to phenomena we can VERB directly , on a ADJ scale . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> these series are named after early researchers who studied them in particular depth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the observed hydrogen - spectrum NOUN can be calculated using the following formula : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , we have used PROPN ’s NOUN to VERB the formula first proposed by PROPN years earlier as a NOUN to fit experimental data . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the NOUN process , an atom is excited to a level several steps above its ground state by the NOUN of a relatively high - energy NOUN photon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called atomic NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once it is excited , the atom can de - VERB in several ways , NUM of which is to re - VERB a photon of the same energy as excited it , a single step back to the ground state . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these energy levels are VERB and are slow in de - ADJ because their quantum numbers differ greatly from those of available lower levels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although these level NOUN are short in human terms , they are many NOUN of magnitude longer than is typical and , thus , are said to be ADJ , meaning relatively stable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the de - NOUN of a ADJ state . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this photon VERB another atom in the ADJ state and stimulates it to decay , VERB a second photon of the same wavelength and in phase with the first , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> stimulated emission is the emission of electromagnetic radiation in the form of NOUN of a given frequency , VERB by NOUN of the same frequency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , an excited atom , with an electron in an energy NOUN higher than normal , releases a photon of a specific frequency when the electron VERB back to a lower energy NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the name NOUN means “ entire picture ” ( from the greek NOUN , as in ADJ ) , because the image is NUM - dimensional . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the process of producing NOUN and , although they are VERB on ADJ NOUN , the process is quite different from normal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN uses light interference or wave NOUN , whereas normal NOUN uses ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> detailed treatment of space NOUN began to explain some NOUN of atomic NOUN , but certain patterns VERB to be caused by something else . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as mentioned , ADJ lines are actually closely ADJ NOUN , a characteristic called ADJ structure , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN changes when a magnetic field is applied , VERB that DET causes the NOUN VERB with a magnetic field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a nucleus that ADV VERB part of its mass to VERB radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a substance or object that VERB nuclear radiation is said to be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM types of experimental evidence VERB that PROPN ’s rays VERB deep in the heart ( or nucleus ) of an atom . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , the radiation is found to be associated with certain elements , such as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another very common radiation NOUN is the PROPN tube . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN and VERB sound we hear in NOUN and NOUN , as well as in our own physics NOUN , is usually an ADJ output of events VERB by a PROPN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> solid - state radiation NOUN convert NOUN produced in a NOUN ( like those found in computer NOUN ) directly into an electrical signal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be VERB that do not conduct current in NUM particular direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> 5 " NOUN rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } <sent_end> <sent_begin> all properties of a nucleus are determined by the number of protons and neutrons it has . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a specific combination of protons and neutrons is called a NOUN and is a unique nucleus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following NOUN is used to represent a particular NOUN : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN decay ( that is , they are ADJ ) , eventually producing a stable NOUN after many NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we call the original NOUN the parent and its decay products the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some ADJ NOUN decay in a single step to a stable nucleus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> certain NOUN decay by the emission of a positive electron . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is NOUN or NOUN decay ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN decay is the ADJ form of nuclear decay — it is the emission of ADJ NOUN by nuclei left in an excited state by some earlier process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> protons and neutrons in an excited nucleus are in higher NOUN , and they fall to lower levels by photon emission ( ADJ to electrons in excited atoms ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> r = NOUN = NOUN size NUM { { PROPN } over { NOUN } } } { } where PROPN size NUM { PROPN } { } is the number of NOUN that occur in time PROPN PROPN size NUM { PROPN } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN unit for activity is NUM decay per second and is given the name NOUN ( PROPN ) in NOUN of the NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , NUM b q = NUM decay / s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM b q = NUM decay / s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { NUM " PROPN " = " NUM decay / s " } { } <sent_end> <sent_begin> activity NOUN size NUM { r } { } is often expressed in other units , such as NOUN per NOUN or NOUN per year . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> experiments have shown that the more ADJ the α α size NUM { α } { } decay of a particular NOUN is , the shorter is its half - life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB this in the following manner : for the decay to be more ADJ , the NOUN must have more energy in the nucleus and should be able to VERB a little ADV to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the barrier is therefore not as thick for more ADJ decay , and the ADJ decrease of the wave function inside the barrier is not as great . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> concentrated damage is more difficult for biological organisms to VERB than damage that is spread out , so short - range particles have greater biological effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the relative biological NOUN ( PROPN ) or quality factor ( PROPN ) is given in [ link ] for several types of VERB radiation — the effect of the radiation is directly proportional to the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN unit more closely related to effects in biological tissue is called the PROPN ADJ man or rem and is defined to be the NOUN in NOUN VERB by the relative biological NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rem = NOUN NUM NOUN rem = NOUN NUM NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> certain researchers even claim that low NOUN are beneficial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a term used to describe generally ADJ biological responses to low NOUN of NOUN or radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such low levels may help certain NOUN mechanisms to develop or enable cells to VERB to the effects of the low NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the central problem in NOUN is to make the NOUN for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the NOUN for normal cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ratio of ADJ cells killed to normal cells killed is called the ADJ ratio , and all NOUN techniques are designed to VERB this ratio . <sent_end> <sent_begin> radiation can be concentrated in ADJ tissue by a number of techniques . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN produces a random NOUN of broken molecules and ions , some with ADJ NOUN or hydrogen - containing molecules known as free NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these undergo rapid chemical reactions , producing perhaps NUM or NUM NUM different compounds called ADJ products , some of which make cell function impossible by VERB cell membranes , VERB dna , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how safe is the food ADV ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this goal , which must be reached before commercial plants can be a reality , has not been achieved . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another NOUN , called break - even , occurs when the fusion power produced VERB the NOUN power input . <sent_end> <sent_begin> break - even has nearly been reached and gives NOUN that NOUN and commercial plants may become a reality in a few decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM techniques have shown considerable promise . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nuclear NOUN is a reaction in which a nucleus is split ( or VERB ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> controlled NOUN is a reality , whereas controlled fusion is a NOUN for the future . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can VERB the number of NOUN produced by neutrons by having a large amount of ADJ material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the minimum amount necessary for self - VERB NOUN of a given NOUN is called its critical mass . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN , such as <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are the ADJ relative to modern NOUN , and include NUM ADJ NOUN of plants : PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like NOUN , they have broad leaves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> flowers VERB by NOUN are usually small , ADJ , and ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN together form the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sexual organs ( NOUN and NOUN ) are located at the center of the flower . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are composed of a thin NOUN called a NOUN and a sac - like structure called the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN supports the NOUN , where the NOUN are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN of VERB plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support , especially because both NOUN and insects VERB at about the same time in the middle PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many NOUN have VERB the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and NOUN , or consumption of plants by insects and other animals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in seed plants , the evolutionary NOUN led to a dominant sporophyte generation , and at the same time , a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte : from a ADJ structure to a ADJ NOUN of cells VERB in the tissues of the sporophyte . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whereas lower vascular plants , such as NOUN NOUN and ferns , are mostly ADJ ( produce only NUM type of NOUN ) , all seed plants , or NOUN , are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they form NUM types of spores : PROPN ( female ) and NOUN ( male ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the process of animal development begins with the NOUN , or series of ADJ cell NOUN , of the zygote ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM cell NOUN VERB the single - ADJ zygote into an NUM - ADJ structure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more complex animals ( those with ADJ NOUN ) develop NUM tissue layers : an inner layer ( NOUN ) , an outer layer ( PROPN ) , and a middle layer ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> animals with NUM tissue layers are called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN include NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN include more complex animals such as NOUN but also some simple animals such as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NUM groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first : mouth or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADV ADJ animals are further divided into NOUN ( including NOUN and NOUN ) and NUM distinct NOUN of NOUN ( including PROPN and PROPN ) ( [ link ] a b ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN includes NOUN and NOUN ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : ADJ NOUN ( termed NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is named for NUM structural features , each common to certain NOUN within the NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> water can enter into the PROPN from numerous NOUN in the body wall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> water entering the PROPN is VERB via a large common opening called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms , including variations in the size of the PROPN , the number of PROPN , and where the cells that VERB food from the water are located . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN - like NOUN of PROPN acts like an NOUN and VERB the ADJ NOUN of sponges . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to the NOUN , sponges have multiple NOUN called NOUN on their bodies that allow water to enter the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some sponges , PROPN are formed by NOUN , single tube - shaped cells that act as NOUN to regulate the flow of water into the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some sponges , NOUN secrete small NOUN into the NOUN , which are composed of either calcium NOUN or NOUN , depending on the type of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN serve to provide additional NOUN to the body of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN contain specialized cells known as PROPN ( “ ADJ cells ” ) containing organelles called NOUN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these cells are present around the mouth and NOUN , and serve to VERB NOUN with NOUN VERB within the cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the outer layer ( from PROPN ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from NOUN ) is called the PROPN and lines the digestive cavity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> between these NUM membrane layers is a non - living , ADV - like PROPN connective layer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in terms of cellular NOUN , NOUN show the presence of ADJ cell types in each tissue layer , such as nerve cells , ADJ ADJ cells , enzyme - VERB cells , and NOUN - VERB cells , as well as the presence of ADJ connections . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the mouth of a sea NOUN is surrounded by NOUN that bear NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN - like mouth opening and NOUN are VERB by a NOUN called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is the ADJ part of the digestive system that serves to VERB as well as ADJ food , and may extend for up to NUM - NOUN the length of the body before opening into the ADJ cavity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN are a ADJ ( about NUM NUM to NUM NOUN ) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the NOUN , a VERB , NOUN - like structure that is covered with NOUN at their anterior end ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although their NOUN is ADV in NOUN , NUM treatment places the NOUN in NUM classes : PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a NOUN VERB in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN serves to capture food and may be VERB with NOUN in some species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN is the ADJ phylum in marine environments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is estimated that NUM percent of all known marine species are NOUN ; there are over NUM described species , making them the second most diverse phylum of animals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN are ADJ animals and fertilization occurs ADV , although this is not the case in terrestrial NOUN , such as NOUN and NOUN , or in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some NOUN , the zygote NOUN and VERB NUM ADJ stages — VERB and NOUN — before becoming a young adult ; NOUN may exhibit a third ADJ stage , PROPN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the phylum includes NOUN , ADJ NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN show ADJ development in embryonic stages and are often called “ ADJ NOUN ” due to their key characteristic of NOUN , or true NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the number and size of PROPN are greatly VERB in PROPN compared to the NOUN ( NOUN = many , PROPN = PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the many NOUN of NOUN are also VERB within ADJ , flat , VERB NOUN that VERB from each segment called NOUN , which may be specialized for different functions in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN PROPN includes NOUN such as PROPN NOUN and PROPN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN may be in the form of a head , NOUN , and NOUN , or a NOUN and NOUN , or a head and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a central cavity , called the PROPN ( or blood cavity ) , is present , and the open circulatory system is regulated by a ADJ or single - ADJ heart . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ systems vary depending on the group of PROPN : insects and NOUN use a series of tubes ( NOUN ) that branch through the body , open to the outside through NOUN called NOUN , and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the NOUN , whereas aquatic NOUN VERB NOUN , terrestrial NOUN VERB book lungs , and aquatic NOUN use book NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN are ADJ , which means that the NOUN are separate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some species like NOUN may be NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , where the NOUN can VERB from producing sperm to PROPN , may also be seen in some species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a “ head ” PROPN is not usually ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the phylum VERB its name from the first pair of NOUN : the NOUN ( [ link ] ) , which are specialized , NOUN - like or X - like NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these animals do not possess ADJ . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN are a type of NOUN that runs above the ground and produces new NOUN plants at nodes at varying NOUN : NOUN are an example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are modified stems that may store NOUN , as seen in the NOUN ( PROPN PROPN . ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN arise as ADJ ends of NOUN , and contain many ADJ or unusual NOUN ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are ADJ , VERB NOUN that enable a plant ( like a NOUN or NOUN ) to seek support by VERB on other surfaces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are modified branches VERB as ADJ NOUN that protect the plant ; common examples include NOUN , PROPN NOUN and NOUN ’s VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN root system VERB deep into the soil . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , a ADJ root system is located ADV to the soil surface , and forms a ADJ network of roots that also helps prevent soil NOUN ( NOUN NOUN are a good example , as are NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some plants have a combination of NOUN roots and ADJ roots . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> leaves that do not have a NOUN and are directly attached to the plant stem are called ADJ leaves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> small green NOUN usually found at the base of the NOUN are known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the number and NOUN of a plant ’s leaves will vary depending on the species , with each species VERB a characteristic leaf arrangement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a simple leaf , the NOUN is either completely ADJ — as in the NOUN leaf — or it has NOUN , but the separation does not reach the NOUN , as in the NOUN leaf . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a compound leaf , the leaf NOUN is completely divided , forming NOUN , as in the NOUN tree . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN may have its own NOUN , but is attached to the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the epidermis is usually NUM cell layer thick ; however , in plants that grow in very ADJ or very cold conditions , the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ layer known as the NOUN covers the leaves of all plant species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is the loss of water from the plant through NOUN at the leaf surface . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is the main NOUN of water movement in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> structures that produce NOUN for the growing plant are referred to as sources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plants have a number of ADJ uses for light that go far beyond their ability to VERB low - molecular - weight sugars using only carbon dioxide , light , and water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the growth and development of plants in response to light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it allows plants to VERB their use of light and space . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of light in the environment is important to plants ; it can be crucial for competition and survival . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the response of plants to light is VERB by different NOUN , which are VERB of a protein ADV VERB to a light - VERB NOUN called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , the NUM are called a PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN occurs on the NOUN side , causing the plant hormone NOUN ADJ acid ( PROPN ) to VERB on the ADJ side . <sent_end> <sent_begin> stem cells VERB under influence of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are another class of blue - light VERB NOUN that also contain a NOUN - based PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN set the plants ADJ activity cycle , also know as its NOUN NOUN , using blue light cues . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term NOUN is derived from the greek word PROPN , which means " to grow . " <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are the main hormones responsible for cell NOUN in NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they also control the NOUN of NOUN into vascular tissue , and promote leaf development and arrangement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( gas ) are a group of about NUM closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot NOUN , seed NOUN , and fruit and flower NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gas are VERB in the root and stem apical NOUN , young leaves , and seed NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN play a major role in defense responses to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their levels increase when a plant is VERB by a NOUN , resulting in an increase in ADJ secondary NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the movement of a plant VERB to constant ADJ pressure is called PROPN , from the greek words PROPN meaning “ NOUN , ” and NOUN VERB “ direction . ” NOUN are NUM example of this . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ region of NOUN is very NOUN sensitive ; light NOUN will VERB a ADJ NOUN response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon , such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbon that was obtained from atmospheric PROPN VERB the majority of the ADJ mass within most plants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the essential elements can be divided into NUM groups : NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> about half of the essential elements are considered NOUN : carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , NOUN , NOUN , calcium , NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> soil develops very ADV over long periods of time , and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on NOUN , rock , and organic compounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> soils can be divided into NUM groups : organic soils are those that are formed from NOUN and primarily composed of organic matter , while those that are formed from the NOUN of NOUN and are primarily composed of inorganic material are called NOUN soils . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN soils are ADJ in terrestrial ecosystems , where soils may be covered by water for part of the year or exposed to the atmosphere . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN sequencing method , several NOUN of a dna NOUN are cut ADV into many smaller NOUN ( somewhat like what happens to a round NOUN NOUN when VERB from a NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of the NOUN are then VERB using the chain - sequencing method . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dna NOUN are methods used to detect gene expression by VERB an NOUN of dna fragments that are fixed to a glass NOUN or a NOUN NOUN to identify active genes and identify sequences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> almost NUM NUM ADJ NOUN can be discovered using NOUN , whereas whole - genome sequencing can provide information about all NUM NUM base pairs in the human genome . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is related to NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves the study of small molecule NOUN found in an organism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is the complete set of NOUN that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are being used to improve NOUN and early NOUN of cancer ; this is achieved by VERB proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an individual protein is called a NOUN , whereas a set of proteins with VERB expression levels is called a protein NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for a NOUN or protein NOUN to be useful as a candidate for early NOUN and NOUN of a cancer , it must be secreted in body fluids , such as NOUN , blood , or NOUN , such that large - scale NOUN can be performed in a non - ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN called this mechanism natural selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> natural selection , also known as “ survival of the ADJ , ” is the more ADJ reproduction of individuals with ADJ traits that survive environmental change because of those traits ; this leads to evolutionary change . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes , evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become ADV different from each other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM species VERB in diverse directions from a common point , it is called ADJ evolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such ADJ evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of VERB plants which share the same basic NOUN ; however , they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and NOUN to different kinds of NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ plants evolved from a common NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some structures exist in organisms that have no ADJ function at all , and appear to be ADJ parts from a past common NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADJ structures without function are called ADJ structures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other examples of ADJ structures are NOUN on ADJ birds , leaves on some NOUN , and ADJ NOUN bones in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , even though ADJ NOUN ( PROPN PROPN ) and african fish NOUN ( PROPN PROPN ) are both birds and NOUN , each VERB to a separate species group ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if humans were to ADV VERB and VERB the egg of a ADJ NOUN with the sperm of an african fish NOUN and a NOUN did VERB , that offspring , called a NOUN ( a cross between NUM species ) , would probably be ADJ — unable to successfully reproduce after it reached NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> different species may have different genes that are active in development ; therefore , it may not be possible to develop a ADJ offspring with NUM different sets of directions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN ( PROPN = " other " ; ADJ = " NOUN " ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN ( ADJ = " same " ; X = " NOUN " ) involves NOUN occurring within a parent species remaining in NUM location . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> reproductive NOUN is the inability to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some cases , a ADJ individual will have NUM or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN “ NOUN ” means “ self , ” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one ’s own species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall that a zygote is a VERB egg : the first cell of the development of an organism that VERB ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , a ADJ barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some cases , populations of a species move or are moved to a new NOUN and take up NOUN in a place that no longer VERB with the other populations of the same species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this situation is called NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> reproduction with the parent species VERB , and a new group exists that is now ADV and ADV independent . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ individuals in many cases can not form normally in the NOUN and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called ADJ NOUN because the ADJ organisms simply are not ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in another ADJ situation , reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a NOUN that is ADJ and unable to reproduce offspring of their own ; this is called ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is the NOUN of phenotype variation that can be VERB to genetic differences , or genetic NOUN , among individuals in a population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the greater the NOUN of a population ’s NOUN variation , the more ADJ it is to the evolutionary forces that act on ADJ variation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while it is likely to happen at some point , it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to ADV VERB the allele from the population , and as a result , the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , if a family of NOUN begins to VERB with each other , this will ADV increase the NOUN of NUM NOUN mating and eventually producing ADJ offspring , a phenomenon known as VERB depression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> genetic NOUN can also be VERB by natural events , such as a natural NOUN that VERB — at random — a large portion of the population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> known as the NOUN effect , it results in a large portion of the genome ADV being VERB out ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM VERB NOUN , the genetic structure of the NOUN becomes the genetic structure of the entire population , which may be very different from the pre - ADJ population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> traits that lead to more NOUN for an individual become selected for by natural selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM common form of mate choice , called ADJ mating , is an individual ’s NOUN to mate with NOUN who are ADV similar to themselves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> natural selection only acts on the population ’s ADJ traits : VERB for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population , while VERB against ADJ alleles and ADV VERB their frequency — a process known as adaptive evolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> natural selection does not act on individual alleles , however , but on entire organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if natural selection VERB an average phenotype , VERB against extreme variation , the population will undergo VERB selection ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a population of NOUN that live in the NOUN , for example , natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best VERB in with the NOUN floor and are less likely to be VERB by NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another type of selection , called frequency - dependent selection , VERB NOUN that are either common ( positive frequency - dependent selection ) or rare ( negative frequency - dependent selection ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of NOUN of the PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the good genes hypothesis states that males develop these ADJ NOUN to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease . <sent_end> <sent_begin> females then choose males with the most ADJ traits because it signals their genetic NOUN , which they will then pass on to their offspring . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scientists use a tool called a ADJ tree to show the evolutionary NOUN and connections among organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists consider ADJ trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to VERB the proposed relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single NOUN evolved into a distinct new one . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN that evolved early from the root and remains ADJ is called basal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM NOUN stem from the same branch point , they are called sister NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many NOUN within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time ; these NOUN together contribute to building , VERB , and VERB the “ tree of life . ” information is used to organize and VERB organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> data may be collected from NOUN , from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism , and by dna analysis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> within each NOUN is a second category called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after NOUN , the subsequent categories of increasing NOUN are : phylum , class , order , family , NOUN , and species ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this usually happens because both organisms were in common NOUN that evolved within similar environmental conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when similar characteristics occur because of environmental NOUN and not due to a close evolutionary relationship , it is called an NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , insects use NOUN to VERB like NOUN and birds , but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to aid in the ADJ task of describing NOUN ADV , scientists often use a concept called maximum NOUN , which means that events occurred in the ADJ , most obvious way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if a group of people VERB a NOUN preserve to go NOUN , based on the principle of maximum NOUN , one could predict that most of the people would VERB on established NOUN rather than VERB new ones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the mitochondria - first hypothesis VERB that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link ] b ) , which ADV acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most ADV , the NOUN - first hypothesis VERB that prokaryotes actually evolved from NOUN by VERB genes and NOUN ( [ link ] c ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of these NOUN are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , single virus particles , are very small , about NUM NOUN in diameter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these individual virus particles are the ADJ form of a virus outside the host cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> viruses come in many shapes and NOUN , but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all NOUN have a nucleic acid genome covered by a ADJ layer of proteins , called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is made up of protein subunits called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN embedded in the viral NOUN are used to VERB to host cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other NOUN proteins are the matrix proteins that VERB the NOUN and often play a role in the NOUN of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN are examples of diseases caused by viruses with NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> their mrna is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group ii viruses have single - VERB dna ( NOUN ) as their genome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they convert their single - VERB genomes into a NOUN intermediate before transcription to mrna can occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> group PROPN viruses have PRON as their genome with a positive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> positive NOUN means that the ADJ rna can serve directly as mrna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN of PROPN , called ADJ NOUN , are made in the process of VERB the ADJ rna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> additionally , full - length positive rna NOUN are made to serve as NOUN for the production of the negative - VERB genome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group PROPN viruses have diploid ( NUM NOUN ) VERB genomes that must be converted , using the enzyme reverse NOUN , to PROPN ; the PROPN is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and VERB into the host genome . then , mrna can be produced by transcription of the viral dna that was VERB into the host genome . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the viral replication cycle can produce dramatic ADJ and structural changes in the host cell , which may cause cell damage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these changes , called ADJ ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even VERB the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as NOUN , die through NOUN ( VERB ) or NOUN ( VERB cell death or “ cell PROPN ” ) , releasing all ADJ NOUN at once . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when infection of a cell by a NOUN results in the production of new NOUN , the infection is said to be productive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the NOUN are released by VERB the cell , the virus VERB by means of a ADJ cycle ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of a ADJ NOUN is PROPN , which VERB PROPN NOUN found in the human ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an example is the animal VERB , including NOUN NOUN viruses , the cause of ADJ and ADJ NOUN in humans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a process called NOUN , these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new NOUN , only to leave NOUN ADV and cause NOUN in the skin where the virus VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even though there are NOUN between PROPN and NOUN , the term ADJ cycle is usually VERB to describe NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> examples of ADJ viral diseases are the common cold and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other viruses cause long - term ADJ NOUN , such as the virus causing NOUN c , whereas others , like NOUN NOUN virus , only cause ADJ symptoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> still other viruses , such as human PROPN NUM and NUM , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease PROPN , often successfully cause productive NOUN without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an ADJ infection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors , through contact with an infected plant ’s NOUN , by living organisms such as insects and NOUN , and through pollen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . <sent_end> <sent_begin> symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM common NOUN is NOUN , the ADJ NOUN of cells that causes the appearance of plant NOUN known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the danger of using live NOUN , which are usually more effective than killed NOUN , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will VERB to their disease - causing form by back mutations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> live NOUN are usually made by VERB ( VERB ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the NOUN in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is VERB to in the host . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN to these new cells or temperatures VERB mutations in the genomes of the virus , allowing it to grow better in the NOUN while VERB its ability to cause disease when VERB into conditions found in the host . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the use of NOUN specific for such bacteria would VERB their resistance to NOUN and specifically VERB them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although NOUN therapy is in use in the republic of georgia to treat ADJ - ADJ bacteria , its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the safety of the treatment was VERB in the united states when the u.s. food and drug administration approved VERB NOUN with NOUN to VERB the food pathogen PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as more and more ADJ - ADJ NOUN of bacteria VERB , the use of NOUN might be a potential solution to the problem , and the development of NOUN therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is this NOUN that VERB the NOUN particle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN exists in NUM forms , PROPN , the normal form of the protein , and PROPN , the ADJ form . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once introduced into the body , the PROPN VERB within the NOUN binds to PROPN and VERB it to PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN or large NOUN may represent the ADJ forms of life on earth ; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about NUM NUM years ago . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN is a ADJ - ADJ NOUN of prokaryotes ( [ link ] ) that includes mostly bacteria , but also NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are a few NOUN thick , and they typically grow where different types of materials NOUN , mostly on ADJ surfaces . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ organisms that convert ADJ energy into chemical energy are called PROPN , and they appeared within NUM NUM years of the formation of earth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> then , NOUN , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple ADJ NUM NUM years later . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( [ link ] ) began the NOUN of the atmosphere . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other cases , ADJ organisms become ADJ under stressful conditions , even though the same organism could be VERB previously . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those organisms that can not be ADJ but are not dead are in a ADJ - but - non - ADJ ( NOUN ) state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental NOUN by entering a ADJ state that allows their survival . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cell wall functions as a ADJ layer , and it is responsible for the organism ’s shape . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some bacteria have an outer NOUN outside the cell wall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other structures are present in some prokaryotic species , but not in others ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are more than NUM different forms of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> s - layer ( surface layer ) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both NOUN and bacteria . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM different types of ADJ cell walls . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM type is composed of PROPN , which is similar to NOUN in NOUN but contains different sugars in the ADJ chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other NUM types of cell walls are composed of NOUN , NOUN , or ADJ protein . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more ADV available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another source of ammonia is NOUN , the process by which ammonia is released during the NOUN of nitrogen - containing organic compounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ammonia released to the atmosphere , however , represents only NUM percent of the total nitrogen released ; the rest is as PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN study how diseases affect a population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a disease that occurs in an ADV high number of individuals in a population at the same time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a widespread , usually worldwide , NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the most ADJ NOUN was the black death ( NUM to NUM ) that is believed to have been another NOUN of ADJ NOUN caused by the NOUN PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is thought to have VERB initially in china and spread along the PROPN PROPN , a network of land and sea trade NOUN , to the ADJ region and europe , carried by NOUN NOUN living on black NOUN that were always present on NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the word NOUN comes from the greek anti meaning “ against ” and NOUN meaning “ life . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a chemical , produced either by NOUN or ADV , that is hostile to the growth of other organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today ’s news and media often address concerns about an ADJ crisis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ disease ( ADV called “ food NOUN ” ) is an illness resulting from the consumption the ADJ bacteria , viruses , or other NOUN that VERB food . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although the united states has NUM of the ADJ food NOUN in the world , the u.s. centers for disease control and PROPN ( PROPN ) has reported that “ NUM NUM people get ADJ , more than NUM are VERB , and NUM americans die each year from ADJ illness . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the characteristics of ADJ NOUN have changed over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> biological nitrogen NOUN ( PROPN ) is ADV carried out by prokaryotes : soil bacteria , NOUN , and PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( ADJ bacteria VERB with PROPN plants such as NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is the use of prokaryotes ( or ADJ metabolism ) to remove NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN has been used to remove agricultural chemicals ( NOUN , NOUN ) that VERB from soil into NOUN and the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some groups of NOUN are photosynthetic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their cells contain , in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles , another kind of NOUN called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when such cells are carrying out photosynthesis , their NOUN are rich in the NOUN chlorophyll a and a range of other NOUN , called NOUN NOUN , which are involved in VERB energy from light . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of NOUN , called PROPN , absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN can function as PROPN , VERB NOUN by PROPN or ADJ NOUN , depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the human NOUN , PROPN PROPN , VERB to a different NOUN of PROPN , the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN PROPN is named after the PROPN , a dna mass carried within the single , ADJ NOUN VERB by each of these cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN includes several NOUN , collectively called NOUN , which cause ADJ human diseases and VERB an NOUN species during a portion of their life cycle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> waste particles are VERB by an ADJ NOUN that VERB at a specific region on the cell membrane , called the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to a NOUN - based digestive system , PROPN also uses ADJ NOUN , which are NOUN vesicles that VERB with water as it enters the cell by NOUN and then contract to VERB water from the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN then VERB its cytoplasm into the NOUN , ADV moving the entire cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of motion , called ADJ NOUN , is used by several diverse groups of NOUN as a means of NOUN or as a method to VERB nutrients and oxygen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example most terrestrial plants form ADJ relationships with fungi . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the roots of the plant VERB with the ADJ parts of the NOUN forming NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> through NOUN , the NOUN and plant exchange nutrients and water , greatly VERB the survival of both species ADV , NOUN are an association between a NOUN and its photosynthetic NOUN ( usually an NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN fungi can change from the NOUN to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ fungi are generally referred to as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN ( PROPN ’s NOUN ) and PROPN species ( the NOUN of NOUN , a common NOUN infection ) are examples of ADJ fungi ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most ADJ NOUN are divided into separate cells by NOUN called PROPN ( singular , NOUN ) ( [ link ] a , c ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in most NOUN of fungi , ADJ NOUN in the PROPN allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most fungi are ADJ NOUN , requiring oxygen to survive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other species , such as the PROPN that VERB in the NOUN of NOUN , are are ADJ NOUN , in that they only use ADJ respiration because oxygen will VERB their metabolism or VERB them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are intermediate , being ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN VERB when they VERB the NOUN , VERB it in a ADJ hold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the tissue of the NOUN by VERB specialized NOUN called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many ADJ fungi possess PROPN , as these structures VERB the tissues of the host , release digestive enzymes within the host 's body , and absorb the VERB nutrients . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when both mating types are present in the same NOUN , it is called PROPN , or self - ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN require NUM different , but ADJ , NOUN to reproduce ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the only class in the phylum PROPN is the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are the ADJ and most ADJ PROPN , or true fungi . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the majority of known fungi belong to the phylum PROPN , which is characterized by the formation of an NOUN ( ADJ , PROPN ) , a sac - like structure that contains haploid NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many NOUN are of commercial importance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is the ADJ stage of the PROPN PROPN and and it is the dominant stage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> eventually , the secondary NOUN VERB a NOUN , which is a VERB body that VERB from the ground — this is what we think of as a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the developing NOUN on the NOUN under its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> art connection <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN is a newly established phylum which VERB about NUM species that all live in close association with the roots of trees . <sent_end> <sent_begin> fossil NOUN indicate that trees and their root NOUN share a long evolutionary history . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both NOUN and pathogens VERB the host ; however , the pathogen causes a disease , whereas the NOUN usually does not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN occurs when NUM member benefits without VERB the other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is the NOUN of humans ( and other animals ) by NOUN VERB by ADJ NOUN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN describes the NOUN of ADJ NOUN in ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , individuals who display NOUN to NOUN and spores develop strong and dangerous ADJ reactions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN can belong to the PROPN , PROPN or PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a second type , the PROPN fungi form ADJ – ADJ interactions with PROPN PROPN ( sometimes called PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in these NOUN , the fungi form VERB that VERB root cells and are the site of the metabolic NOUN between the NOUN and the host plant ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN also consider green algae to be plants , although others VERB all algae from the plant NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the reason for this NOUN stems from the fact that only green algae , the PROPN , share common characteristics with land plants ( such as using chlorophyll a and b plus NOUN in the same NOUN as plants ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these characteristics are ADJ in other types of algae . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM different types of spores are produced in land plants , resulting in the separation of NOUN at different points in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ non - vascular plants produce only NUM kind of NOUN and are called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the male spores are called NOUN , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the ADV larger NOUN develop into the female gametophyte . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is observed in a few ADJ vascular plants and in all seed plants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the NOUN , NOUN cells give rise to gametes by mitosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the male NOUN ( PROPN ) releases sperm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many ADJ plants produce sperm VERB with NOUN that enable them to VERB in a ADJ environment to the PROPN : the female NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a further division , land plants are classified into NUM major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue , as detailed in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> plants that lack vascular tissue , which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients , are referred to as non - vascular plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN are ADJ , non - vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN plants can also reproduce ADV , by the NOUN of branches or the NOUN of leaf fragments called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this ADJ type of reproduction , the NOUN — small , ADJ , complete NOUN of plant that are produced in a NOUN on the surface of the NOUN ( shown in [ link ] ) — are VERB out of the NOUN by NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN then land ADV and develop into NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , NOUN are present on the stems of the sporophyte , and a ADJ vascular system runs up the sporophyte ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> additionally , NOUN are VERB to the substrate — whether it is soil , rock , or NOUN NOUN — by multicellular NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these structures are NOUN of roots . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a structure called a ADJ increases the spread of spores after the NOUN of the NOUN falls off at NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ tissue around the mouth of the NOUN is made of ADJ , close - VERB units , a little like “ teeth ” ; these open and close depending on NOUN levels , and ADV release spores . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the tissue consists of conducting cells , known as PROPN , and ADJ NOUN tissue , called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ADJ cells VERB the compound VERB into their walls , and are thus described as VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN itself is a complex NOUN that is ADJ to water and VERB mechanical strength to vascular tissue . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN cones , mature NOUN of ferns , and flowers are all NOUN — leaves that were modified ADV to bear NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are NOUN - like structures that contain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are prominent in NOUN and are commonly known as NOUN cones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> phylum PROPN : class PROPN ( PROPN ferns ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> while most ferns form large leaves and VERB roots , the NOUN ferns , class PROPN , lack both roots and leaves , probably lost by reduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> photosynthesis takes place in their green stems , and small yellow NOUN form at the NOUN of the branch stem and contain the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some seeds are VERB by sporophyte tissues upon NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the NOUN , and later , the embryo , is called the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> female cones , or VERB cones , contain NUM NOUN per scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM NOUN mother cell , or PROPN , VERB meiosis in each NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN VERB in ADJ NOUN , and are often ADJ for NOUN because of the shape of their large , compound leaves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN bear large cones ( [ link ] ) , and may be VERB by NOUN rather than NOUN : unusual for a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what is biology ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> in simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with NUM another and their environments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is a very broad definition because the NOUN of biology is vast . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the steps of the scientific method will be VERB in detail later , but NUM of the most important aspects of this method is the NOUN of NOUN by means of ADJ experiments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although using the scientific method is ADJ to science , it is ADJ in determining what science is . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for some NOUN , the natural PROPN are NOUN , biology , NOUN , earth science , and physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other scholars choose to divide natural NOUN into life NOUN , which study living things and include biology , and physical NOUN , which study VERB matter and include NOUN , NOUN , physics , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN such as NOUN and NOUN build on both life and physical NOUN and are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both types of ADJ thinking are related to the NUM main NOUN of scientific study : ADJ science and hypothesis - based science . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ ( or discovery ) science , which is usually ADJ , VERB to VERB , explore , and VERB , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually ADJ , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be VERB . the NOUN between these NUM forms of study is often VERB , and most scientific NOUN combine both NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN VERB with brief , but broad , NOUN information about what is known in the field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a good NOUN also gives the NOUN of the work ; it VERB the work carried out and also ADV VERB the end of the paper , where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN require a results section followed by a discussion section , but it is more common to combine both . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the journal does not allow the combination of both NOUN , the results section simply VERB the NOUN without any further interpretation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the results are presented by means of NOUN or NOUN , but no ADJ information should be presented . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> atoms form molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least NUM atoms held together by NUM or more chemical bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many molecules that are ADV important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by NOUN ( a NOUN is a large molecule that is made by VERB smaller units called NOUN , which are ADJ than macromolecules ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> examples of organelles include mitochondria and NOUN , which carry out ADJ functions : mitochondria produce energy to power the cell , while NOUN enable green plants to VERB the energy in sunlight to make sugars . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the ADJ fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( this requirement is why viruses are not considered living : they are not made of cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organs are NOUN of tissues VERB together VERB a common function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organs are present not only in animals but also in plants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NOUN may include many NOUN trees . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the ADJ , non - living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or NOUN water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the highest level of organization ( [ link ] ) , the NOUN is the collection of all ecosystems , and it represents the zones of life on earth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it includes land , water , and even the atmosphere to a certain extent . art PROPN biological levels of organization of living things are shown . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN may VERB NUM of those NOUN and work in a more focused field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , molecular biology and NOUN study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as dna , rna , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - ADJ organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , another branch of biology , uses NOUN to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and NOUN are the study of animals and plants , respectively . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> matter is any substance that VERB space and has mass . <sent_end> <sent_begin> elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM elements , but only NUM occur naturally . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is ADV charged whereas a NOUN is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom VERB significantly to its mass , but not to its charge . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the number of neutrons is variable , resulting in NOUN , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess . <sent_end> <sent_begin> together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’s mass number , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that the small NOUN of mass from electrons is VERB in VERB the mass number . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the group NUM atoms NOUN ( he ) , NOUN ( PROPN ) , and NOUN ( PROPN ) all have filled outer electron NOUN , making it ADJ for them to share electrons with other atoms to VERB stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their non - NOUN has resulted in their being named the ADJ gases ( or ADJ gases ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> compare this to the group NUM elements in the left - hand NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM electrons VERB the NUM NOUN , and the third electron then VERB the NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its electron NOUN is PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( PROPN ) , on the other hand , has a total of NUM electrons : NUM are in its ADJ NUM ADJ and NUM VERB its second shell ( NUM each in the NUM and NUM p NOUN ) ; thus , it is an ADJ gas and ADV stable as a single atom that will ADV form a chemical bond with other atoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> chemical reactions occur when NUM or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when VERB atoms are broken apart . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction ; this direction is not always a “ NUM - way street . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> for the creation of the water molecule shown above , the chemical equation would be : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some chemical reactions , such as the one shown above , can VERB in NUM direction until the reactants are all used up . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN that describe these reactions contain a ADJ NOUN and are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ reactions are those that can go in either direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ ADJ bonds form between NUM atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , molecular oxygen ( NOUN ) is ADJ because the electrons will be equally VERB between the NUM oxygen atoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> water also VERB or is VERB to other polar molecules and ions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a polar substance that VERB ADV with or VERB in water is referred to as ADJ ( X = “ water ” ; NUM = “ NOUN ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , non - polar molecules such as NOUN and NOUN do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than VERB in it , as we see in NOUN NOUN containing oil and NOUN ( an ADJ water solution ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> specific heat is defined as the amount of heat NUM NOUN of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by NUM degree PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for water , this amount is NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can ADV VERB in it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , water is referred to as a NOUN , a substance capable of VERB other polar molecules and ADJ compounds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN allows for the development of surface tension , the capacity of a substance to VERB being VERB when placed under tension or stress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is also why water forms NOUN when placed on a ADJ surface rather than being VERB out by gravity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you might have even used some to test whether the water in a NOUN NOUN is ADV treated . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN scale is , as previously mentioned , an ADJ NOUN and VERB from NUM to NUM ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PRON below NUM ( VERB from NUM to NUM ) is ADJ , and PRON above NUM ( from NUM to NUM ) is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen , such as NOUN ( PROPN ) described above . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we often use NOUN in our daily lives as NOUN — like the NOUN in a gas NOUN or the NOUN in a ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM - dimensional NOUN of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the NOUN ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> structural NOUN ( like NOUN and PROPN shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the NOUN of their ADJ bonds : both molecules have NUM NOUN and NUM NOUN ( PROPN ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the NUM - dimensional NOUN of atoms so that they are NOUN images . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] , an amino acid NOUN example , the NUM structures are non - ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you VERB learned , biological macromolecules are large molecules , necessary for life , that are built from smaller organic molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM major classes of biological macromolecules ( carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids ) ; each is an important cell component and VERB a wide NOUN of functions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> carbohydrates can be represented by the ADJ formula ( PROPN ) n , where n is the number of NOUN in the molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is NUM : NUM : NUM in NOUN molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the most ADJ natural NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell wall of plants is mostly made of NOUN ; this provides structural support to the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM fatty acids in the NOUN may be similar or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are also called PROPN or NOUN because of their chemical structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some fatty acids have common names that VERB their origin . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN indicate the NOUN of the molecule around the double bond . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NOUN are present in the same plane , it is referred to as a PROPN fat ; if the hydrogen atoms are on NUM different NOUN , it is referred to as a ADJ fat . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN double bond causes a NOUN or a “ NOUN ” that VERB the fatty acids from VERB ADV , keeping them liquid at room temperature ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are major constituents of the plasma membrane , the outermost layer of animal cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like NOUN , they are composed of fatty acid NOUN attached to a NOUN or NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> amino acids are the NOUN that make up proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each amino acid has the same fundamental structure , which consists of a central carbon atom , also known as the NOUN ( α ) carbon , VERB to an amino group ( PROPN ) , a NOUN group ( PROPN ) , and to a hydrogen atom . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the local NOUN of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most common are the α - helix and β - ADJ NOUN structures ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in nature , some proteins are formed from several NOUN , also known as subunits , and the interaction of these subunits forms the ADJ structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> weak interactions between the subunits help to VERB the overall structure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM main types of nucleic acids are NOUN acid ( dna ) and ADJ acid ( rna ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dna is the genetic material found in all living organisms , VERB from single - ADJ bacteria to multicellular mammals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dna and rna are made up of NOUN known as nucleotides . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nucleotides combine with each other to form a NOUN , dna or rna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each nucleotide is made up of NUM components : a ADJ base , a NOUN ( NUM - carbon ) sugar , and a phosphate group ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are VERB as NUM , NUM , NUM , NUM , and NUM ( NUM is read as “ NUM NOUN ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the phosphate NOUN is attached to the NOUN group of the NUM carbon of NUM sugar and the NOUN group of the NUM carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide , which forms a NUM NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN is not formed by simple NOUN reaction like the other NOUN VERB NOUN in macromolecules : its formation involves the removal of NUM phosphate groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you have learned , information flow in an organism takes place from dna to rna to protein . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dna VERB the structure of mrna in a process known as transcription , and rna VERB the structure of protein in a process known as translation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as the central PROPN of life , which holds true for all organisms ; however , NOUN to the rule occur in connection with viral NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast to light NOUN , electron NOUN ( [ link ] b ) use a NOUN of electrons instead of a NOUN of light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> not only does this allow for higher NOUN and , thus , more detail ( [ link ] ) , it also provides higher VERB power . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we will ADV come to see that this is significantly different in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prokaryotic dna is found in a central part of the cell : the PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this figure shows the ADJ structure of a prokaryotic cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all prokaryotes have ADJ dna VERB in a NOUN , NOUN , a cell membrane , and a cell wall . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear NOUN ( a structure to be discussed ADV ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is made up of organelles VERB in the NOUN - like NOUN , the NOUN , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nuclear NOUN is a double - membrane structure that VERB the outermost portion of the nucleus ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear NOUN are NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle , proteins are attached to chromosomes , and they VERB an ADV , VERB NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these VERB protein - chromosome NOUN are called NOUN ( [ link ] ) ; PROPN describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when VERB and VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mitochondria ( singular = NOUN ) are often called the “ NOUN ” or “ energy NOUN ” of a cell because they are responsible for making NOUN NOUN ( atp ) , the cell ’s main energy - carrying molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> atp represents the short - term stored energy of the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is a NOUN - VERB center found near the nuclei of animal cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains a pair of NOUN , NUM structures that VERB ADJ to each other ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> like the mitochondria , NOUN have their own dna and NOUN , but NOUN have an entirely different function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide , water , and light energy to make glucose and oxygen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> within the cytoplasm , there would still be ions and organic molecules , plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell , secure some organelles in specific positions , allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell , and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move . <sent_end> <sent_begin> collectively , this network of protein fibers is known as the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM types of fibers within the NOUN : PROPN , intermediate NOUN , and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the walls of the NOUN are made of ADJ NOUN of α - NOUN and β - NOUN , NUM ADJ proteins ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a diameter of about NUM NOUN , NOUN are the ADJ components of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they help the cell VERB NOUN , provide a NOUN along which vesicles move through the cell , and VERB VERB chromosomes to opposite ends of a VERB cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN fibers are VERB with NOUN - containing protein molecules called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> collectively , these materials are called the extracellular matrix ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue , but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also found only in animal cells are NOUN , which act like NOUN NOUN between adjacent ADJ cells ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> short proteins called NOUN in the plasma membrane VERB to intermediate NOUN to create NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the plasma membrane of human red blood cells is NUM percent NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbohydrates are present only on the ADJ surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins , forming NOUN , or attached to lipids , forming NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the head can form hydrogen bonds , but the tail can not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a molecule with this arrangement of a ADV or ADV charged area and an ADJ , or non - polar , area is referred to as ADJ or “ ADJ - NOUN . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell , and prevent some ADJ materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , plasma membranes are ADV ADJ — they allow some substances to pass through , but not others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if they were to lose this NOUN , the cell would no longer be able to VERB itself , and it would be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> diffusion is a ADJ process of transport . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the integral proteins involved in VERB transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins , and they function as either channels for the material or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in both cases , they are NOUN proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADV named protein binds a substance and , in doing so , triggers a change of its own shape , moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior ( [ link ] ) ; depending on the gradient , the material may move in the opposite direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a solution 's NOUN often directly VERB with the NOUN of the solution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as for a ADJ solution , the NOUN NOUN refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher NOUN than the cell ’s cytoplasm ; therefore , the fluid contains less water than the cell does . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water , water will leave the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell ’s energy , usually in the form of NOUN NOUN ( atp ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient — that is , if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid ( and vice ADV ) — the cell must use energy to move the substance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM mechanisms exist for the transport of small - molecular weight material and small molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on atp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the ADJ gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require atp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an important membrane NOUN for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or NOUN to VERB movement : there are NUM types of these proteins or NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN carries NUM specific ion or molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN carries NUM different ions or molecules , both in the same direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sodium - NOUN NOUN is , therefore , an ADJ NOUN ( a NOUN that creates a charge NOUN ) , creating an electrical NOUN across the membrane and VERB to the membrane potential . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a variation of NOUN is called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this literally means “ cell NOUN ” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was ADV taking in extracellular fluid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in receptor - VERB NOUN , as in NOUN , PROPN is attached to the ADJ side of the plasma membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NOUN of a compound is dependent on receptor - VERB NOUN and the process is ADJ , the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just as living things must ADV consume food to VERB what has been used , cells must ADV produce more energy to VERB that used by the many energy - requiring chemical reactions that ADV take place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells , including those that use energy and those that release energy , are the cell ’s metabolism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the matter and its environment ADJ to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system , and everything outside of that system is called the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , a NOUN ball that is not in motion is ADJ of VERB work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a VERB NOUN , a VERB person , the rapid movement of molecules in the air ( which produces heat ) , and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how can the energy released from NUM reaction be compared to that of another reaction ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> a measurement of free energy is used to VERB these energy NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> free energy is called PROPN free energy ( VERB with the NOUN g ) after PROPN PROPN PROPN , the scientist who developed the measurement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy - VERB molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these chemical reactions are called ADJ reactions , and they are non - ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the source of the NOUN energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> heat energy ( the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction ) VERB up the motion of molecules , increasing the frequency and force with which they VERB ; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly , helping them reach their NOUN state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , VERB up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to VERB more frequently . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there may be NUM or more NOUN , depending on the particular chemical reaction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this model VERB that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in NUM ADJ step . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , current research supports a more ADJ view called induced fit ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the induced - fit model VERB upon the VERB - and - key model by describing a more ADJ interaction between enzyme and substrate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many enzymes do n’t work ADV , or even at all , unless bound to other specific non - protein NOUN molecules , either ADV through ADJ or hydrogen bonds or ADV through stronger ADJ bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM types of NOUN molecules are NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> binding to these molecules VERB ADJ NOUN and function for their ADJ enzymes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this NOUN makes the PROPN and atp molecules ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the release of NUM or NUM phosphate groups from atp , a process called NOUN , releases energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most of the atp generated during glucose NOUN , however , is derived from a much more complex process , PROPN , which takes place in mitochondria ( [ link ] ) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , a process of atp production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate NUM percent of the atp made during glucose NOUN and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to VERB the energy of sunlight . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the production of atp using the process of PROPN is called ADJ NOUN because of the involvement of oxygen in the process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nearly all living organisms carry out NOUN as part of their metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process does not use oxygen and is therefore ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the cell can not VERB the NOUN molecules further , it will VERB only NUM atp molecules from NUM molecule of glucose . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mature ADJ red blood cells are not capable of ADJ respiration — the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen — and NOUN is their ADJ source of atp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NOUN is VERB , these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium - NOUN NOUN , and eventually , they die . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the protein passes along the PROPN ’s NOUN , it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after its synthesis is complete , it VERB as integral membrane protein of the NOUN that NOUN from the PROPN ’s ADJ face and when the NOUN VERB with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : modification of work by PROPN PROPN ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the smooth NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) is continuous with the NOUN but has few or no NOUN on its ADJ surface ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> functions of the PROPN include synthesis of carbohydrates , lipids , and NOUN hormones ; NOUN of NOUN and NOUN ; and storage of calcium ions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> complex ii directly receives PROPN , which does not pass through complex i . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the compound VERB the first and second NOUN to the third is NOUN ( q ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the q molecule is NOUN ADJ and ADV moves through the ADJ core of the membrane . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both methods are called ADJ cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed NOUN ( “ other NOUN ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a third very interesting group of bacteria VERB sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by VERB energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN are typically located on the NOUN of the leaf , which helps to VERB water loss . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN is VERB by NOUN cells that regulate the opening and NOUN of the NOUN by VERB or VERB in response to ADJ changes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in all ADJ NOUN , photosynthesis takes place inside an NOUN called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for plants , NOUN - containing cells exist in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> embedded in the NOUN membrane is chlorophyll , a NOUN ( molecule that VERB light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN membrane VERB an internal space called the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] , a NOUN of NOUN is called a NOUN , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the NOUN is called NOUN or “ NOUN ” ( not to be VERB with NOUN or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> art connection <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the light - dependent reactions , energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the light - independent reactions , the chemical energy VERB during the light - dependent reactions drive the NOUN of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , although the light - independent reactions do not use light as a NOUN , they require the products of the light - dependent reactions to function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN must then be VERB and , thus , can not be directly observed because that would amount to a permanent NOUN of mass - energy conservation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such particles ( like the NOUN above ) are called ADJ particles , because they can not be directly observed but their effects can be directly observed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB all this , PROPN used the information on the range of the strong nuclear force to VERB the mass of the NOUN , the particle that carries it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he shared the NUM PROPN PROPN with PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN PROPN for work in PROPN with its deep NOUN for particle physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why is it that particles called NOUN are listed as the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force when , in the PROPN particle and the PROPN PROPN principle PROPN , we saw that NOUN ADV carry that force ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the answer is that NOUN are VERB but they have a NOUN and , as we explore it , we find that the strong force is actually related to the ADV observed but more fundamental NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , all the carrier particles are thought to be fundamental in the sense that they have no NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have been mentioned at various points in this NOUN as fundamental building blocks and members of the exclusive NOUN of ADV ADJ particles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that an ADJ or fundamental particle has no NOUN ( it is not made of other particles ) and has no ADJ size other than its wavelength . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this does not mean that fundamental particles are stable — some decay , while others do not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> originally , NUM NOUN types — or NOUN — were proposed to account for the then - known NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN NOUN are named up ( PROPN ) , down ( d ) , and ADJ ( s ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all NOUN have half - integral NOUN and are thus NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN to the NOUN of electric and magnetic forces is quite good — the NUM forces are distinct under normal circumstances , but there are NOUN of connections even on the atomic scale , and there may be conditions under which the forces are ADV related and even ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the search for a correct theory VERB the forces , called the PROPN PROPN theory ( PROPN ) , is VERB in this section in the realm of particle physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of physics VERB the story in making a connection with NOUN , on the opposite end of the distance scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] is a PROPN diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle z NUM z NUM size NUM { z rsup { size NUM { NUM } } } { } , similar to the NOUN in [ link ] and [ link ] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is beyond the NOUN of this NOUN to go into more detail on the types of NOUN and NOUN interactions that VERB the ADJ particles , but the theory ( quantum NOUN or PROPN ) is very self - consistent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so successful have PROPN and the NOUN theory been that , taken together , they are called the standard model . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN in knowledge are expected to VERB , but not VERB , the standard model of particle physics and forces . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> collectively , these essential workers are called the bureaucracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bureaucracy is an ADJ group of ADJ officials charged with carrying out functions connected to a series of policies and programs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , the bureaucracy began as a very small collection of individuals . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> eventually , after president james PROPN had been VERB by a ADJ office NOUN ( [ link ] ) , congress responded to NOUN for reform with the PROPN act , also called the civil service reform act of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the act established the civil service commission , a ADJ agency charged with VERB that the federal government ’s selection , NOUN , and NOUN practices were based on open , competitive NOUN in a NOUN system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for more on the PROPN act and its effects see PROPN PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the republican president and congress were not seen as moving ADV enough to VERB the situation , the democrats won the NUM election in ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> president franklin d. roosevelt and the u.s. congress rapidly VERB the government ’s problem - solving efforts into a series of programs designed to VERB the economy , stimulate economic development , and generate employment opportunities . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the 1930s , the federal bureaucracy grew with the addition of the federal deposit insurance corporation to protect and regulate u.s. banking , the national labor relations board to regulate the way companies could treat their workers , the PROPN and exchange commission to regulate the stock market , and the civil PROPN board to regulate air travel . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all of these new programs required NOUN to run them , and the national bureaucracy naturally VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its size became a VERB NOUN for NOUN , who eventually elected ronald reagan president for the express purpose of reducing the bureaucracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while reagan was able to work with congress to reduce some aspects of the federal bureaucracy , he VERB to its expansion in other ways , particularly in his efforts to fight the cold war . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for more on PROPN and the great society see : john PROPN andrew . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second , the law raised the NOUN for employment in civil service positions by requiring NOUN to pass NOUN designed to test their NOUN in a number of important NOUN and knowledge areas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> third , it allowed for the creation of the united states civil service commission ( PROPN ) , which was charged with VERB the elements of the law . united states civil service commission . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> congress and the president responded with the civil service reform act of NUM , which VERB the civil service commission . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in its place , the law created NUM new federal agencies : the office of PROPN management ( PROPN ) and the PROPN systems protection board ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN has responsibility for NOUN , VERB , and VERB potential government employees in order to choose those who should be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> later sociologists have not always VERB so ADV upon NOUN , and they have developed ADJ models to explain how and why NOUN function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM such model is called the ADJ model of bureaucracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ model VERB that NOUN are naturally competitive and power - ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> agencies formed by the federal government to VERB a ADJ - business NOUN are called government corporations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they exist because the services they provide are ADV subject to market forces and tend to generate enough profit to be self - VERB , but they also VERB a ADJ service the government has an interest in VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once the NOUN of implementation have been VERB out in the legislation VERB a new program , NOUN move to VERB it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when they VERB ADJ areas , many follow the federal VERB NOUN process to VERB a solution , that is , VERB how particular new federal NOUN , regulations , and/or programs will be VERB in the agencies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> congress can not ADV VERB on that level of detail , so the NOUN in the bureaucracy do so . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps congress ’s most powerful NOUN tool is the government PROPN office ( PROPN ) . X ( may NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is an agency that provides congress , its committees , and the NOUN of the executive agencies with NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is designed to operate in a fact - based and ADJ manner to VERB important NOUN information where and when it is needed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a more extreme , and in many instances , more controversial solution to the perceived and real NOUN in the bureaucracy is NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , largely because it was born during the PROPN and has a long history of VERB free - market principles , the NOUN to VERB government services has never been as strong as it is in many other countries . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> new york : PROPN , PROPN & PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , much of the debate over gun safety policy in the united states has VERB on the NOUN of congress to act , even in the face of public opinion that supports some changes to gun policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , NUM of the last major changes occurred in NUM , when lawmakers ’ NOUN resulted in the NOUN of a piece of legislation known as the federal PROPN weapons ban ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ everything you need to know about the NOUN weapons ban , in NUM post , ” the washington post , NUM december NUM .

<sent_begin> during the great depression of the 1930s , the united states created a set of policies and programs that VERB a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs , their homes , and their savings ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under president franklin PROPN roosevelt , the federal government began programs like the work progress administration and PROPN conservation PROPN to combat unemployment and the home owners ’ loan corporation to VERB depression - related NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of free - market economics believe that the market forces of supply and demand , working without any government involvement , are the most effective way for markets to operate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the basic principles of free - market economics is that for just about any good that can be VERB , the most efficient means for exchange is the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists consider goods like NOUN NOUN , NOUN service , and private schools to be NOUN goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN goods are similar to public goods in that they are open to all and ADV ADJ if maintained , but they are paid for or provided by some outside ( ADJ ) NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , PROPN PROPN argued that it was possible to VERB policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or VERB across the many . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM policy category , known as ADJ policy , tends to VERB payments or resources from many but VERB direct benefits on relatively few . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are often developed through ADJ policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ journalists — called NOUN by politicians and business leaders who were the focus of their NOUN — began to VERB many of the ways in which NOUN were VERB the public NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although various forms of NOUN VERB the list of NOUN , among the most famous NOUN NOUN was the PROPN , a NUM NOUN by PROPN PROPN that focused on ADJ working conditions and ADJ business practices in the NOUN - NOUN industry . PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the u.s. government began developing a social welfare policy during the great depression of the 1930s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by the 1960s , social welfare had become a major function of the federal government — NUM to which most public policy funds are VERB — and had developed to serve several VERB functions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the ADJ and largest NOUN of social welfare policy is social security , which cost the united states about $ NUM NUM in NUM alone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ an NOUN to the budget and economic PROPN : NUM to NUM , ” NUM august NUM . PRON ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these costs are VERB by a NUM percent payroll tax on all wages up to $ NUM ; employers and workers who are not self - employed split the bill for each worker , whereas the self - employed pay their entire share . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ NOUN NUM , ” PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social security was VERB as a solution to several problems ADJ to the industrial era economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , by the NOUN and 1930s , an increasing number of workers were earning their living through NOUN or day - wage labor that VERB on their ability to engage in physical activity ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during the george w. bush administration , social security became a highly ADJ topic as the republican party sought to find a way of preventing what NOUN VERB would be the ADJ NOUN of the social security system ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the ratio of workers paying into the program to NOUN receiving payments was NUM to NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more than NUM percent of all health care dollars spent were being spent by the u.s. government well before the PROPN was VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you have already learned , medicare was created decades earlier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> despite NOUN ’ resistance to government involvement in health care , there is no keeping government out of medicare ; the government is medicare . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second approach to creating public policy is a NOUN more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rather than starting with what VERB to happen and seeking ways to make it so , policy NOUN try to identify all the possible choices available to a decision NOUN and then VERB their NOUN if VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the goal of the NOUN is n’t really to encourage the implementation of any of the NOUN ; rather , it is to make sure decision NOUN are fully ADJ about the NOUN of the decisions they do make . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> acid NOUN provides another ADJ NOUN of agenda setting and the problems and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> acid NOUN is a widely recognized problem that did not make it on to the governmental policy agenda until congress passed the air quality act of NUM , long after environmental groups started VERB for laws to regulate pollution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> until the 1930s , most policy NOUN argued that the best way for the government to interact with the economy was through a hands - off approach ADV known as X - NOUN economics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN believed the key to economic growth and development was the government ’s allowing private markets to operate ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the end of NOUN : how higher taxes will VERB the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new york : PROPN & PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they called for an approach known as supply - side economics , which VERB that economic growth is largely a function of the productive capacity of a country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> supply - NOUN have argued that increased regulation and higher taxes reduce the incentive to VERB new money into the economy , to the point where little growth can occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in theory , the amount of revenue raised by the national government should be equal to these NOUN , but with the exception of a brief period from NUM to NUM , that has not been the case . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the economic recovery from the NUM recession , and budget control efforts VERB since then , have VERB to cut the annual deficit — the amount by which expenditures are greater than NOUN — by more than half . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the amount of money the u.s. government needed to borrow to pay its bills in NUM was still in excess of $ NUM NUM <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ the federal budget in NUM : an PROPN , ” NUM january NUM . DET ( march NUM , NUM ) . . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> supply - NOUN , on the other hand , prefer ADJ tax systems , which lower the overall rate as individuals make more money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this does not ADV mean the wealthy pay less than the poor , simply that the percentage of their income they pay in taxes will be lower . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if you have read or VERB the news for the past several years , perhaps you have heard the names PROPN PROPN , PROPN PROPN , or PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN are recent past NOUN of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ; PROPN is the current NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> domestic issues can sometimes become international ones when it comes to such topics as foreign trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here , president george w. bush VERB hands with legislators and administration officials after VERB the central american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) implementation act on august NUM , NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of stability that comes from other u.s. foreign policy goals is NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while ADV looking out for its own ADJ interests in VERB foreign policy strategy , the united states ADV attempts to support international NOUN through many aspects of its foreign policy , such as foreign aid , and through its support of and participation in international organizations such as the united nations , the north PROPN treaty organization ( PROPN ) , and the organization of american states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on june NUM , NUM , house minority leader PROPN PROPN ( d - PROPN ) VERB PROPN secretary - general ban PROPN - PROPN , california governor PROPN brown , and other NOUN to VERB the ADJ NOUN of the NOUN of the PROPN PROPN in PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : modification of work by “ PROPN PROPN ” / PROPN ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a country is said to be engaging in NOUN when it does not VERB other countries to sell goods and services within its NOUN , or when it charges them very high tariffs ( or NOUN taxes ) to do so . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the other end of the spectrum is a free trade approach , in which a country allows the ADJ flow of goods and services between itself and other countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at times the united states has been free trade – oriented , while at other times it has been ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for many , foreign policy is ADJ with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the establishment and maintenance of a formal relationship between countries that VERB their interactions on matters as diverse as NOUN , the NOUN of goods they trade , and the NOUN of NOUN on each other ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while ADJ relations are not always ADJ , when they are operating it does suggest that things are going well between the countries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such war can be ADJ , as were the iraq war in NUM and the NUM removal of ADJ leader PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> or it can be ADJ , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the PROPN PROPN war in NUM , also known as operation PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the potential for military NOUN , and indeed the NOUN about the NOUN of NOUN of u.s. military NOUN , can also be a potential source of foreign policy strength for the united states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> profits , in turn , are also determined by the price of the NOUN the firm VERB and by the price of the inputs , like labor or ADJ materials , the firm needs to buy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> aggregate supply ( as ) refers to the total quantity of output ( X . <sent_end> <sent_begin> real gdp ) firms will produce and sell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when an economy is operating at its potential gdp , NOUN and NOUN are running at capacity , and the unemployment rate is relatively low — at the natural rate of unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , potential gdp is sometimes also called full - employment gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the united states while remaining fixed in other countries , then goods in the united states will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> u.s. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> u.s. imports from abroad will be relatively ADJ , so the quantity of imports will rise . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for this reason , what we have been VERB the as curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( PROPN ) curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the vertical line at potential gdp may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( PROPN ) curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , the u.s. economy experienced NOUN in NUM – NUM , NUM – NUM , NUM – NUM , NUM , and NUM – NUM that were each VERB or VERB by a rise in the key input of oil prices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the 1970s , this pattern of a shift to the left in PROPN leading to a ADJ economy with high unemployment and inflation was VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the PROPN curve to the right , providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from NUM to NUM , for example , the average price of ADJ oil VERB by almost half , from $ NUM a NOUN to $ NUM a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if changes of a few percentage points of gdp seem small to you , remember that since gdp was about $ NUM NUM in NUM , a ADV small change of NUM % of gdp is equal to close to $ NUM NUM . tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending , too . <sent_end> <sent_begin> tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand , while tax increases will tend to VERB it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> tax policy can also VERB up investment demand by VERB lower tax rates for corporations or tax NOUN that benefit specific kinds of investment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM types of unemployment were described in the unemployment chapter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ unemployment VERB up and down according to the short - run movements of gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over the long run , in the united states , the unemployment rate typically VERB around NUM % ( give or take NUM percentage point or so ) , when the economy is healthy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> focus first on the keynesian zone , that portion of the PROPN curve on the far left which is relatively flat . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the ad curve VERB this portion of the PROPN curve at an equilibrium point like PROPN , then certain statements about the economic situation will follow . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the idea is simple : firms produce output only if they expect it to sell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , while the NOUN of the factors of production VERB a nation ’s potential gdp , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real gdp , depends on how much demand exists across the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this point is illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the keynesian ad / as PROPN keynesian view of the ad / as model uses an PROPN curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a NOUN , the economy experiences inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the key policy NOUN for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during NOUN and VERB spending during NOUN to return aggregate demand to VERB potential output . recall from the aggregate supply - aggregate demand model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( aggregate demand ( ad ) is actually what economists call total VERB expenditure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> investment falls into NUM categories : producer ’s ADJ equipment and NOUN , new ADJ structures ( such as NOUN , NOUN , and ADJ NOUN ) , changes in NOUN , and ADJ structures ( such as single - family homes , NOUN , and NOUN NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ) keynesian economics focuses on VERB why NOUN and NOUN occur and VERB a policy NOUN for VERB their effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the keynesian view of recession is based on NUM key building blocks . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , aggregate demand is not always ADV high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second , ADJ price changes may leave NOUN ADJ or ADJ — especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these costs of changing prices are called NOUN costs — like the costs of VERB up a new set of NOUN with different prices in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prices do respond to forces of supply and demand , but from a macroeconomic perspective , the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , when investment spending VERB during the great depression , it caused a much larger decrease in real gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the size of the NOUN is critical and was a key element in recent NOUN of the NOUN of the obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus NOUN , ADV VERB the american recovery and PROPN act of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern became known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( recall from the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model that NOUN is an ADJ combination of high unemployment and high inflation . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he proposed that the government could VERB money ADV , and let NOUN companies get started to VERB the money up again . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN were slightly NOUN - in - NOUN , but their purpose was to VERB that a great depression is no time to VERB over the NOUN of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to VERB up aggregate demand by enough to VERB the economy to potential gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the neoclassical perspective on PROPN holds that , in the long run , the economy will VERB around its potential gdp and its natural rate of unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this chapter begins with NUM building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential gdp , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will VERB in a ADJ manner so that the economy will VERB back to its potential gdp level of output . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> actual or real gdp is VERB against the potential gdp to determine how well the economy is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> growth in gdp can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as NOUN in technology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> neoclassical economists who focus on potential gdp as the primary NOUN of real gdp argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential gdp — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential gdp , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a vertical PROPN curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential gdp ) will determine the real gdp of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological NOUN shift potential gdp and the vertical PROPN curve gradually to the right . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after all , many people and firms are not especially well ADJ , either about what is VERB in the economy or about how the economy works . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ADJ assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually VERB their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect NOUN of information and accurate NOUN of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the NOUN from the short run and long run will be VERB out in ADJ steps that occur over time . the ADJ evidence on the speed of macroeconomic NOUN of prices and wages is not clear - cut . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the keynesian perspective introduced the PROPN curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the short run upward VERB aggregate supply curve implies a downward ADJ PROPN curve ; thus , there is a NOUN between inflation and unemployment in the short run . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to VERB the ADJ shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , the neoclassical view is not especially ADJ in VERB why unemployment moves up and down over short time NOUN of a few years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nor is the neoclassical model especially ADJ when the economy is VERB in an especially deep and long - VERB recession , like the great depression of the 1930s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no VERB gains in terms of lower unemployment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at this point , you should have ADV in mind the main goals of NOUN from PROPN to economics PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you should also understand keynesian and neoclassical NOUN for macroeconomic analysis and how these NOUN can be VERB in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( ad / as ) model . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with the goals and NOUN for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the NUM main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( we will get to its definition soon . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , money serves as a NOUN of exchange , which means that money acts as an NOUN between the buyer and the seller . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead of VERB accounting services for shoes , the NOUN now VERB accounting services for money . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of ADJ payment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means that if money is ADJ today to make purchases , it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of course , gold also has value because of its NOUN and NOUN in the creation of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as NOUN money , gold has ADV served its purpose as a NOUN of exchange , a store of value , and as a unit of account . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - VERB NOUN are dollar bills or other NOUN with values VERB up by gold or other NOUN held at a bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during much of its history , the money supply in the united states was VERB by gold and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> less liquid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federal reserve bank , which is the central bank of the united states , is a bank NOUN and is responsible for monetary policy and VERB money according to its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM NOUN of money : m1 and m2 money supply . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a broader definition of money , m2 includes everything in m1 but also VERB other types of deposits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , m2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily VERB the money at an automatic NOUN machine or bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to VERB in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are VERB together and VERB in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> where does “ ADJ money ” like NOUN NOUN , credit NOUN , and ADJ money fit into this picture ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN card , like a check , is an NOUN to the NOUN ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is important to note that in our definition of money , it VERB deposits that are money , not the paper check or the NOUN card . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM key message underlying this discussion of m1 and m2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and NOUN ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , the macroeconomic policies VERB money are largely conducted through the banking system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the next section VERB how banks function and how a nation ’s banking system has the power to create money . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> banks as financial PROPN “ NOUN ” is NUM who VERB between NUM other parties . <sent_end> <sent_begin> banks are a financial NOUN — that is , an institution that VERB between a NOUN who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> financial NOUN include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and NOUN funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be NOUN institutions , which are institutions that VERB money deposits and then use these to make loans . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a bank ’s balance PROPN balance NOUN is an accounting tool that VERB assets and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this case , a home is the NOUN , but the NOUN is the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the net worth is the NOUN value minus how much is VERB ( the NOUN ) . a bank ’s balance NOUN VERB in much the same way . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many banks issue home loans , and charge various NOUN and processing NOUN for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who VERB the loan payments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the market where loans are made to NOUN is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived NOUN of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is VERB strongly , what NOUN of loans of this type will be VERB ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the greater the risk that a loan will not be VERB , the less that any financial institution will pay to VERB the loan . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN offers certain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be ADV ADJ if the local economy VERB , so that many people are unable to make their payments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to NOUN than it is receiving from NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how can banks protect themselves against an ADV high rate of loan NOUN and against the risk of an NOUN - NOUN time NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM strategy is for a bank to VERB its loans , which means VERB to a variety of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , VERB a bank specialized in NOUN to a NOUN market — say , making a high NOUN of its loans to construction companies that build NOUN in NUM NOUN area . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and VERB that a nation ’s financial system VERB ADV is called the central bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most nations have central banks or currency NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the federal reserve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the goal is not only to protect individuals ’ savings , but to protect the NOUN of the financial system itself . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> banks are allowed to make loans to businesses , individuals , and other banks . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are allowed to purchase u.s. treasury NOUN but , to protect NOUN , they are not VERB to VERB in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , it is a bank ’s net worth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the practical question is that measuring the value of a bank ’s assets is not always ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as discussed in money and banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on NOUN about the risk that these loans will not be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or VERB financial NOUN that are much more complex than a basic loan . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the political question VERB because the decision by a bank NOUN to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank NOUN often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep ADJ and back off . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> about NUM countries around the world , including all of the major economies , have deposit insurance programs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , the federal deposit insurance corporation ( PROPN ) is responsible for deposit insurance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> banks pay an insurance NOUN to the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the u.s. is open market NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> open market NOUN take place when the central bank VERB or VERB u.s. treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their NOUN or on deposit with the central bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to VERB out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a monetary policy that VERB interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or ADJ monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , a monetary policy that VERB interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a ADJ monetary policy or ADJ monetary policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing NOUN with different risk NOUN and loans that are to be VERB over different periods of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in general , when the federal funds rate VERB substantially , other interest rates VERB , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in [ link ] ( b ) , the original equilibrium ( PROPN ) occurs at an output of NUM , which is above potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ monetary policy will raise interest rates , VERB borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( PROPN ) to shift left to PROPN , so that the new equilibrium ( NOUN ) occurs at the potential gdp level of NUM examples suggest that monetary policy should be ADJ ; that is , it should act to VERB the business cycles of economic NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> monetary policy should be VERB when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and VERB when inflation VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with the recession still ADJ , the PROPN decided to VERB an ADJ and ADJ policy known as ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the purchase of long - term government and private NOUN - VERB NOUN by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule VERB them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally VERB limit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , during a recession banks may be ADJ to VERB , because they fear that when the economy is VERB , a high NOUN of loan NOUN become less likely to VERB their loans . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ movements of PROPN is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money VERB through the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the velocity of money in a year is defined as : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the nominal interest rate is NUM % and the rate of inflation is NUM % , then the borrower is effectively paying a NUM % real interest rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the nominal interest rate is NUM % and there is NOUN of NUM % , then the real interest rate is actually NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so far at least , it has VERB difficult to draw clear NOUN between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down NOUN in m1 . <sent_end> <sent_begin> given many changes in banking and the NOUN of ADJ banking , m2 is now VERB as a measure of money rather than the ADJ m1 . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the neoclassical model , the level of potential gdp ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential gdp ) is determined by real economic factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the original level of aggregate demand is PROPN , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to PROPN only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter gdp or unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , the law VERB the federal reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists have no final NOUN on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for those who VERB to the inflation VERB philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are ADJ about slow economic growth and unemployment will ADV pressure the central bank to conduct a ADJ monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to VERB such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at a broader level , some economists VERB about a NOUN cycle , where “ NOUN ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> when economic times are good , banks and the financial NOUN are ADJ to VERB , and people and firms are ADJ to borrow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money ADJ — a process of loans being made , money being VERB , and more loans being made . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this chapter VERB the international NOUN of money , which involves NOUN from NUM currency to another at an exchange rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of NUM currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be VERB with the tools of supply and demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first NOUN of this chapter begins with an NOUN of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the NOUN for VERB movements of exchange rates . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you have VERB the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the international trade and capital flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare gdp statistics from countries where gdp is measured in different NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these earlier examples , however , took the actual exchange rate as given , as if it were a fact of nature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the other kind of international financial investment , NOUN investment , involves a ADV financial investment that does not VERB any management responsibility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example would be a u.s. financial NOUN who VERB bonds issued by the government of the united PROPN , or VERB money in a british bank . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as NOUN , then trade the foreign exchange . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called the NOUN market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the horizontal axis shows the quantity of mexican NOUN VERB in the foreign exchange market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the demand curve ( d ) for mexican NOUN VERB with the supply curve ( s ) of mexican NOUN at the equilibrium point ( e ) , which is an exchange rate of NUM NOUN in u.s. currency for each mexican NOUN and a total volume of NUM NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that the NUM exchange rates are NOUN : NUM NOUN per dollar is the same as NUM NOUN per NOUN ( or $ NUM per NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the price of cars was much higher than $ NUM in this example , then at least some ADJ buyers would convert their ADJ dollars to u.s. dollars and go to the united states to purchase their cars . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as NOUN , the process of buying and selling goods or NOUN across international NOUN at a profit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it may occur ADV , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to VERB so that the price of ADV VERB goods is similar in all countries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) ADJ substantial NOUN in the exchange rate can VERB international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an ADJ balance of trade and large NOUN of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let ’s discuss these NOUN in turn . <sent_end> <sent_begin> exchange rates , aggregate demand , and aggregate supply <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM – NUM , countries across ADJ asia , like PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN , experienced a ADJ NOUN of their NOUN , in some cases NUM % or more . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these countries had been VERB substantial NOUN of foreign investment capital , with bank NOUN increasing by NUM % to NUM % per year through the NOUN NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when their exchange rates VERB , the banking systems in these countries were ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a VERB exchange rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. dollar is a VERB exchange rate , as are the NOUN of about NUM % of the countries in the world economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a government VERB in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ NOUN ” for its currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a soft NOUN is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in NUM direction , the central bank will VERB in the market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a hard NOUN exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and ADJ value for the exchange rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the central bank can expand the money supply by creating NOUN , use the NOUN to purchase foreign NOUN , and avoid selling any of its own currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this way , it can VERB the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , when a country VERB its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would VERB its exchange rate and break its hard NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a soft NOUN exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes VERB the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may VERB inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft NOUN exchange rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a hard NOUN policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , even though the goal of a soft NOUN policy is to reduce short - term NOUN of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when VERB in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term NOUN as international investors try to VERB how and when the central bank will act . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following clear it up feature VERB the effects of international capital flows — capital that flows across national NOUN as either NOUN investment or direct investment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but NOUN to limit international financial flows have severe practical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> taxes are imposed by national governments , not international ones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this chapter , we VERB fiscal policy , which was first covered in PROPN to economics PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> fiscal policy is NUM of NUM policy tools for ADJ NOUN the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while monetary policy is made by NOUN at the federal reserve , fiscal policy is made by congress and the president . the discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government VERB and spending affects aggregate demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the federal government VERB more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it VERB in a year , it runs a budget surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a ADJ budget . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when most people think of taxes VERB by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on april NUM ( or the first business day after ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( VERB in social insurance and NOUN NOUN ) , which provides funds for social security and medicare . <sent_end> <sent_begin> payroll taxes have increased ADV over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a ADJ tax , meaning that people with higher NOUN pay a smaller share of their income in tax . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the federal government has a few other , smaller sources of revenue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB an NOUN tax — that is , a tax on a particular good — on gasoline , NOUN , and alcohol . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a share of gdp , the amount collected by these taxes has VERB nearly constant over time , from about NUM % of gdp in the 1960s to roughly NUM % by NUM , according to the ADJ congressional budget office . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the NOUN of VERB debt rather than annual deficits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the national debt refers to the total amount that the government has VERB over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been VERB in NUM particular year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows the ratio of debt / gdp since NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the millions of ADJ in NUM – NUM could VERB unemployment insurance benefits to VERB some of their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> federal fiscal policies include ADJ fiscal policy , when the government passes a new law that ADV changes tax or spending levels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the stimulus NOUN of NUM is an example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the NOUN between ADJ unemployment and inflation , were a NOUN of the past . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the cover of its december NUM , NUM , issue , time NOUN , then the PROPN news NOUN in the united states , ran a picture of john PROPN keynes , and the story inside identified keynesian theories as “ the ADJ influence on the world ’s economies . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the article reported that NOUN have “ used keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of ADJ days but to produce ADJ economic growth and to achieve ADV stable prices . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ NOUN , however , did not last . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. economy VERB NUM recession from december NUM to november NUM , a ADJ recession from november NUM to march NUM , and then double - NOUN NOUN from january to june NUM and from july NUM to november NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a NOUN has started , and a few months more to VERB that it is ADV a recession and not just a NOUN or NUM - NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after this NOUN , NOUN become aware of the problem and VERB fiscal policy bills . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most economists view the NOUN for a ADV ADJ budget with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , in the short term , economists would expect the budget deficits and NOUN to VERB up and down with the economy and the automatic NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the national saving and investment identity , first introduced in the international trade and capital flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. economy has NUM main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the u.s. economy and public savings . <sent_end> <sent_begin> total savings = private savings ( s ) + public savings ( t – g ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> total savings = private savings ( s ) + public savings ( t – g ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> these include the NOUN of foreign financial capital from abroad . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when government borrowing VERB up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as VERB out . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to understand the potential impact of VERB out , consider the situation of the u.s. economy before the ADJ circumstances of the recession that started in late NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , for example , the budget deficit was roughly NUM % of gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits , causing a rise in interest rates and VERB out private investment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential gdp , VERB an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may VERB with a ADJ monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by ADJ monetary policy , and the government borrowing might VERB out a great deal of private investment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential gdp , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might VERB with expansionary monetary policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the united states pay a substantial share of the cost of their education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for NOUN - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a situation using the exchange rate for the u.s. dollar , measured in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the original equilibrium ( PROPN ) , where the demand for u.s. dollars ( PROPN ) VERB with the supply of u.s. dollars ( PROPN ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is NUM NOUN per u.s. dollar and the equilibrium quantity VERB in the market is $ NUM NUM per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – PROPN trading in exchange rate markets in the NOUN NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you will quickly see that VERB this diversity is ADJ with challenges and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as explained in the macroeconomic perspective , we must consider using purchasing power NOUN or “ international dollars ” to convert average NOUN into ADJ units . <sent_end> <sent_begin> purchasing power NOUN , as ADV defined in exchange rates and international capital flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the macroeconomic perspective explained how to measure gdp , the challenges of using gdp to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of VERB economic size with distribution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> where does economic growth come from ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to most economists who believe in the growth NOUN , economic growth ( as discussed in economic growth ) is built on a foundation of productivity NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in turn , productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology , all VERB in a market - driven economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> lack of saving means a lack of capital NOUN and a lack of ADJ funds for investment in physical and human capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recent research by NUM PROPN economists , PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN , has VERB that the households in these economies are VERB in low NOUN because they can not VERB enough investment to push themselves out of poverty . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the average citizen of PROPN , the lowest - income country , VERB on $ NUM per year ( adjusted to NUM dollars ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to data collected by the central intelligence agency in its PROPN PROPN , as of NUM , NUM % of PROPN ’s population is ADJ , with NOUN and tea as the main income producing NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the monetary policy NOUN for VERB with recession is ADJ : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top NOUN , can usually VERB some reduction in interest rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with regard to fiscal policy , the automatic NOUN discussed in government PROPN and fiscal policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic NOUN , governments in a recession should try to VERB ADJ fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN of the high - income economies appear to have learned some NOUN about fighting inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , DET happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming ADJ in the economy in the ADJ and long term . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is a long list of NOUN about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental NOUN , ADJ labor practices , and many other concerns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are discussed at some length in the international trade and capital flows . of all of the NOUN for NOUN on trade , perhaps the most controversial NUM among economists is the NOUN industry argument ; that is , VERB or protecting new industries for a time until they become established . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( globalization and PROPN VERB this concept in more detail . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead of VERB net financial investment abroad , the u.s. economy is VERB up savings from all over the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these substantial u.s. trade deficits may not be ADJ according to PROPN PROPN writing for the national bureau of economic research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while trade deficits on their own are not bad , the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and VERB up to the beginning of world war i . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over that time , global exports as a share of global gdp VERB from less than NUM % of gdp in NUM to NUM % of gdp in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a country has an absolute advantage in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> absolute advantage can be the result of a country ’s natural NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB , let ’s say that PROPN PROPN and the united states each have NUM worker hours ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we VERB what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier ( PROPN ) graph , shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall from choice in a world of NOUN that the production VERB frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources , in this case workers , and its level of technology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> absolute advantage simply VERB the productivity of a worker between countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB the question , “ how many inputs do i need to produce shoes in mexico ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> comparative advantage VERB this same question slightly differently . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should VERB to a degree in certain products , and then exchange those products . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a high NOUN of trade , however , is ADJ - industry trade — that is , trade of goods within the same industry from NUM country to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the united states produces and exports NOUN and imports NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , recent years have seen a NOUN in international trade called NOUN up the value chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the value chain describes how a good is produced in stages . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as VERB in the beginning of the chapter , the production of the PROPN involves the design and NOUN of the NOUN in the united states , parts supplied from PROPN , the NOUN of the parts in china , and the NOUN and NOUN done in the united states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for ADJ reasons , and protecting against NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a government VERB policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ policies often seek to VERB domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules , regulations , NOUN , and NOUN to make it more ADJ or difficult to VERB products . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low NOUN NOUN , for instance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the extra NUM NOUN of sugar production , shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in brazil , is VERB to the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , at a price of NUM NOUN , the farmers produce a quantity of NUM NOUN and consumers demand a quantity of NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ motion is the motion of an object VERB or VERB into the air , subject to only the acceleration of gravity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the object is called a NOUN , and its path is called its NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both are quite different from the velocity of an NOUN relative to its NOUN ( which should be close to NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> relative NOUN are NUM aspect of relativity , which is defined to be the study of how different NOUN moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] ( b ) is our first example of a free - body diagram , which is a technique used to VERB all the external forces acting on a body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the body is represented by a single ADJ point ( or free body ) , and only those forces acting on the body from the outside ( external forces ) are shown . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> external forces are any outside forces that act on a body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a free - body diagram is a NOUN of all external forces acting on a body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the answer is that a change in motion is ADJ to a change in velocity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a change in velocity means , by definition , that there is an acceleration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> newton ’s first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion ; thus , we see that a net external force causes acceleration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the net external force on an object is its weight , we say that it is in free - fall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> section PROPN ’s third law of motion represents a basic NOUN in nature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it states : ADV NUM body VERB a force on a second body , the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that the first body VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a tension is a force along the length of a NOUN , especially a force carried by a ADJ NOUN , such as a NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word “ tension ” comes from a latin word meaning “ to VERB . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> not ADV , the ADJ NOUN that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you feel a smaller NOUN force when you VERB your hand so only the side goes through the air — you have VERB the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like friction , the NOUN force always VERB the motion of an object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike simple friction , the NOUN force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> consider a line from the center of the PROPN to its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN used to record sound along this line moves through the same angle in the same amount of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rotation angle is the amount of rotation and is ADJ to linear distance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> any net force causing ADJ circular motion is called a ADJ force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the direction of a ADJ force is toward the center of NOUN , the same as the direction of ADJ acceleration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB these vast NOUN , we must also have accepted units in which to express them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and we shall find that ( even in the ADV ADJ discussion of NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ) a ADJ NOUN of nature appears — all physical quantities can be expressed as NOUN of only NUM fundamental physical quantities : length , mass , time , and electric current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we define a physical quantity either by VERB how it is measured or by VERB how it is calculated from other measurements . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , we define distance and time by VERB methods for measuring them , whereas we define average speed by VERB that it is calculated as distance VERB divided by time of travel . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is an ADJ fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined only in terms of the NOUN used to measure them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the units in which they are measured are thus called fundamental units . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this NOUN , the fundamental physical quantities are taken to be length , mass , time , and electric current . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN unit for length is the NOUN ( VERB m ) ; its definition has also changed over time to become more accurate and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN was first defined in NUM as NUM / NUM of the distance from the NOUN to the north pole . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term order of magnitude refers to the scale of a value expressed in the ADJ system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each power of NUM size NUM { " NUM " } in the ADJ system represents a different order of magnitude . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a model is a representation of something that is often too difficult ( or impossible ) to display directly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while a model is VERB with experimental NOUN , it is only accurate under limited situations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as scientists VERB and VERB information about the world , they follow a process called the scientific method . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process typically begins with an observation and question that the scientist will research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these theories deal with the very ADJ and the very small , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> relativity must be used ADV an object is VERB at greater than about NUM % of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the sun . <sent_end> <sent_begin> quantum NOUN must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> average velocity is displacement ( change in position ) divided by the time of travel , <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , for this NOUN to the store , the position , velocity , and speed - NOUN - time NOUN are VERB in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( note that these NOUN VERB a very ADJ model of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we are VERB that speed is constant during the NOUN , which is ADJ given that we VERB probably stop at the store . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when an object VERB down , its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN in PROPN PROPN , brazil , VERB as it comes into a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first note that NOUN in this NOUN have ADJ NOUN , NUM horizontal and the other vertical . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM physical quantities are VERB against NUM another in such a graph , the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if we call the horizontal axis the PROPN size X } { } - axis and the vertical axis the y y size NUM { y } { } - axis , as in [ link ] , a straight - line graph has the general form y = m x + b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> y = m x + b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { y = ital " m x " + ` b } { } <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , if you had obtained a measurement of NUM NOUN , your measurement would not be very accurate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a measurement system is refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements ( which are repeated under the same conditions ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider the example of the paper measurements . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM " NOUN " } { } , and he or she must VERB the value of the last NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> using the method of significant NOUN , the rule is that the last NOUN written down in a measurement is the first NOUN with some NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order to determine the number of significant NOUN in a value , start with the first measured value at the left and VERB the number of NOUN through the last NOUN written on the right . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> distance is an example of a ADJ quantity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a vector is any quantity with both magnitude and direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other examples of vectors include a velocity of NUM NOUN / h east and a force of NUM NOUN straight down . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the head - to - tail method is a ADJ way to add vectors , described in [ link ] below and in the steps following . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector , and the head ( or NOUN ) of a vector is the final , ADJ end of the NOUN . head - to - tail method : the head - to - tail method of ADV adding vectors is illustrated for the NUM NOUN of the person VERB in a city considered in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> step NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to get the magnitude of the NOUN , measure its length with a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( note that in most NOUN , we will use the ADJ NOUN to determine this length . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> 0 { size NUM { NUM } } } { } north of east . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is an example of VERB a vector by a positive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB that the magnitude changes , but the direction VERB the same . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the NOUN is negative , then VERB a vector by it changes the vector ’s magnitude and gives the new vector the opposite direction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ methods of vector addition and NOUN VERB NOUN and simple NOUN rather than the NOUN and NOUN of ADJ methods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> part of the ADJ technique is VERB , because vectors are still represented by NOUN for easy NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather than VERB our experience , newton ’s first law of motion states that there must be a cause ( which is a net external force ) for there to be any change in velocity ( either a change in magnitude or direction ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we will define net external force in the next section . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is ADV more difficult to change the motion of a large NOUN than that of a NOUN , for example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of an object is measured by its mass . <sent_end> <sent_begin> roughly speaking , mass is a measure of the amount of “ NOUN ” ( or matter ) in something . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is related to an object ’s mass . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what is it that carries forces between objects ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM way to answer this question is to imagine that a force field surrounds DET object creates the force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a second object ( often called a test object ) placed in this field will experience a force that is a function of location and other variables . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the ADJ characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the contact surface between systems and always in a direction that VERB motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if NUM systems are in contact and moving relative to one another , then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , friction VERB a NOUN NOUN VERB on NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN VERB earth because it is very nearly an ADJ frame of reference — NUM in which all forces are real ( that is , in which all forces have an ADJ physical origin ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in such a frame of reference , newton ’s laws of motion take the form given in dynamics : newton 's laws of motion the car is a non - ADJ frame of reference because it is VERB to the side . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the force to the left VERB by car NOUN is a ADJ force having no physical origin . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a person standing next to the NOUN - go - round VERB the ball moving straight and the NOUN - go - round VERB ADP it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN - go - round ’s frame of reference , we explain the ADJ curve to the right by using a ADJ force , called the PROPN force , that causes the ball to curve to the right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ PROPN force can be used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow ADJ NOUN and allows us to apply newton ’s laws in non - ADJ NOUN of reference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> looking down on the ADJ rotation of a NOUN - go - round , we see that a ball VERB straight toward the NOUN follows a path ADJ to the right . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN refers to an environment in which the ADJ net acceleration of a body is small compared with that produced by earth at its surface . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many interesting biology and physics topics have been studied over the past NUM decades in the presence of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for work , in the scientific sense , to be done , a force must be VERB and there must be displacement in the direction of the force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , the work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for NUM - way motion in NUM NOUN , this is expressed in equation form as <sent_end>
<sent_begin> work is done by a force , and some forces , such as weight , have special characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a conservative force is NUM , like the gravitational force , for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and VERB points of a motion and not on the path taken . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can define a potential energy ( PROPN ) ( PROPN ) size NUM { NOUN ( " PROPN " NOUN ) } { } for any conservative force , just as we did for the gravitational force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conservative forces were discussed in conservative forces and potential energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ force is NUM for which work depends on the path taken . <sent_end> <sent_begin> friction is a good example of a ADJ force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many of these will be covered in later NOUN , but let us detail a few here . <sent_end> <sent_begin> electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , such as gasoline and food , carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we sometimes refer to this as ADJ energy , or electromagnetic radiation , which includes visible light , ADJ , and ADJ radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nuclear energy comes from processes that convert ADJ amounts of mass into energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nuclear energy is transformed into the energy of sunlight , into electrical energy in power plants , and into the energy of the heat transfer and NOUN in weapons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the rate at which the body uses food energy to VERB life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the total energy NOUN rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate ( PROPN ) and is divided among various systems in the body , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the largest NOUN goes to the liver and NOUN , with the brain coming next . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ forms of energy are those sources that can not be used up , such as water , NOUN , ADJ , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> about NUM % of our energy comes from ADJ fossil NOUN — oil , natural gas , NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a link between global NOUN and fossil NOUN use , with its production of carbon dioxide through NOUN , has made , in the eyes of many scientists , a shift to non - fossil NOUN of ADJ importance — but it will not be easy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in [ link ] , a very large force acting for a short time had a great effect on the momentum of the NOUN ball . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a small force could cause the same change in momentum , but it would have to act for a much longer time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if the ball were VERB upward , the gravitational force ( which is much smaller than the NOUN NOUN ’s force ) would eventually reverse the momentum of the ball . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we start with the elastic NOUN of NUM objects moving along the same line — a NUM - dimensional problem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an elastic NOUN is one that also VERB internal kinetic energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic NOUN of the objects in the system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic NOUN of the objects in the system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we will not consider such rotation until later , and so for now we VERB things so that no rotation is possible . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to avoid rotation , we consider only the NOUN of point NOUN — that is , ADJ particles that can not VERB or VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we start by VERB that <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a system is in ADJ equilibrium if , when VERB , it experiences a net force or NOUN in the same direction as the displacement from equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a system in ADJ equilibrium VERB away from its equilibrium position if VERB even slightly . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN ’s ADJ motion is exactly ADJ to the fact that the NOUN ’s large ADJ acceleration produces a large final velocity , and the distance VERB will also be large . NOUN is the NOUN of motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of ADJ motion describes the relationships among rotation angle , ADJ velocity , ADJ acceleration , and time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let us start by finding an equation VERB NUM NUM size NUM { NUM } { } , α α size NUM { α } { } , and t t size NUM { t } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> clearly , the motor had to work to get the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this work went into heat , light , sound , NOUN , and considerable ADJ kinetic energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what is the direction of the ADJ momentum of a VERB object like the NOUN in [ link ] ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the figure shows the right - hand rule used to find the direction of both ADJ momentum and ADJ velocity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both l l size NUM { l } { } and PROPN NUM size NUM { NUM } { } are vectors — each has direction and magnitude . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you have no ADV heard the word pressure being used in NOUN to blood ( high or low blood pressure ) and in NOUN to the NOUN ( ADJ and low - pressure NOUN systems ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are only NUM of many examples of pressures in fluids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> blood pressure measurements , like NOUN pressures , are thus made relative to atmospheric pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in brief , it is very common for pressure NOUN to VERB atmospheric pressure — that is , to read NUM at atmospheric pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we therefore define NOUN pressure to be the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN pressure is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure , and negative for pressures below it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> stated in words , PROPN ’ principle is as follows : the ADJ force on an object VERB the weight of the fluid it VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in equation form , PROPN ’ principle is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN can , for example , be held in open NOUN because ADJ forces hold the molecules together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ forces between molecules of different types are called ADJ forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such forces cause liquid VERB to VERB to NOUN NOUN , for example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if , however , it is too low , NOUN is a problem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ pressure increases ADV during exercise to increase blood flow and returns to normal ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this change produces no ADJ effects and , in fact , may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure , called ADJ pressure , which is normally in the range of NUM to NUM NUM PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the circulation of fluid in the eye is VERB , it can lead to a NOUN in pressure , a condition called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the net pressure can become as great as NUM NOUN PROPN , an ADV large pressure that can ADV damage the ADJ nerve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the relationship between pressure and velocity in fluids is described ADV by PROPN ’s equation , named after its NOUN , the ADJ scientist daniel PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s equation states that for an ADJ , ADJ fluid , the following sum is constant : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ flow is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ flow , or NOUN , is characterized by NOUN and VERB that VERB layers of fluid together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the consequences of NOUN is a resistance force called ADJ NOUN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> membranes are generally ADV ADJ , or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> reverse NOUN and reverse NOUN ( also called NOUN ) are processes that occur when back pressure is sufficient to reverse the normal direction of substances through membranes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> back pressure can be created naturally as on the right side of [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the scientific definition of temperature is less ADJ than your senses of ADJ and cold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> temperature is ADV defined to be what we measure with a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( many physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is , heat will flow from the ADJ object to the ADJ NUM until they have exactly the same temperature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the objects are then in thermal equilibrium , and no further changes will occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the systems interact and change because their temperatures differ , and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thermal stress is created by thermal expansion or contraction ( see elasticity : stress and VERB for a discussion of stress and NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thermal stress can be ADJ , such as when expanding gasoline VERB a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can VERB aspects of the behavior of a substance by VERB a graph of pressure versus volume , called a PROPN diagram . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the substance VERB like an ideal gas , the ideal gas law describes the relationship between its pressure and volume . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for water , there is no liquid phase at pressures below NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the phase change from solid to gas is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it accounts for large losses of NOUN NOUN that never make it into a river , the ADJ automatic NOUN of a NOUN , and the NOUN - NOUN process applied to many NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> partial pressure is defined as the pressure a gas would create if it VERB the total volume available . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a mixture of gases , the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases , VERB ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> relative NOUN VERB us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at its maximum , VERB as NOUN , the relative NOUN is NUM % , and NOUN is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the transfer of energy is caused by the temperature difference , and VERB once the temperatures are equal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these observations lead to the following definition of heat : heat is the ADJ transfer of energy due to a temperature difference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as noted in temperature , kinetic theory , and the gas laws , heat is often ADJ with temperature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is heat transfer through ADJ matter by physical contact . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( the matter is ADJ on a ADJ scale — we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute NUM . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is , the ADJ body VERB electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin : no NOUN is required for electromagnetic waves to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> different names are used for electromagnetic waves of different NOUN : radio waves , NOUN , ADJ radiation , visible light , ADJ radiation , x - rays , and NOUN rays . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most of the heat transfer from this fire to the NOUN is through ADJ radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the visible light , although dramatic , VERB relatively little thermal energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first law of thermodynamics VERB the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat transfer and doing work are the methods of VERB energy into and out of the system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system VERB the net heat transfer into the system minus the net work done by the system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in equation form , the first law of thermodynamics is <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN and their relationship to work done on or by a PROPN process by which a gas does work on a NOUN at constant pressure is called an ADJ process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the pressure is constant , the force VERB is constant and the work done is given as p NOUN v . <sent_end> <sent_begin> p NOUN v . size NUM { p NOUN v } { } <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both ADJ and ADJ processes such as shown in [ link ] are ADJ in principle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ process is NUM in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the reverse ADJ and ADJ NOUN are PROPN and PROPN , respectively . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this question was VERB at a ADJ level in NUM by a young french NOUN , PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , in his study of the then - VERB heat NOUN technology crucial to the industrial revolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he VERB a ADJ cycle , now called the PROPN cycle , which is the most efficient ADJ process possible . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second law of thermodynamics can be VERB in terms of the PROPN cycle , and so what PROPN actually discovered was this fundamental law . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there is yet another way of VERB the second law of thermodynamics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this version VERB to a concept called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by VERB it , we shall see that the directions associated with the second law — heat transfer from ADJ to cold , for example — are related to the tendency in nature for systems to become ADJ and for less energy to be available for use as work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] NOUN of all the ways in which NUM NOUN can be VERB , taking into account the order in which NOUN and NOUN occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each sequence is called a NOUN — a detailed NOUN of every element of a system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN create waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN creates sound waves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are also the ADJ ADJ systems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> simple ADJ motion ( PROPN ) is the name given to ADJ motion for a system where the net force can be described by PROPN ’s law , and such a system is called a simple ADJ NOUN . if the net force can be described by PROPN ’s law and there is no NOUN ( by friction or other non - conservative forces ) , then a simple ADJ NOUN will VERB with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium position , as shown for an object on a spring in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with less - than critical NOUN , the system will return to equilibrium ADV but will VERB and cross over NUM or more times . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such a system is ADJ ; its displacement is represented by the curve in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> curve b in [ link ] represents an PROPN system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when you drive the ball at its natural frequency , the ball ’s NOUN increase in amplitude with each NOUN for as long as you drive it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it , called its wavelength <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the rules for adding waves are quite simple . when NUM or more waves VERB at the same point , they VERB themselves on NUM another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more specifically , the disturbances of waves are VERB when they come together — a phenomenon called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each disturbance VERB to a force , and forces add . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the NUM waves have the same amplitude and wavelength , then they VERB between ADJ and ADJ interference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ looks like a wave standing in place and , thus , is called a standing wave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> waves on the glass of NOUN are NUM example of standing waves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , the fundamental frequency is PROPN = v NOUN / λ NUM = v NOUN / NUM l NOUN = v NOUN / λ NUM = v NOUN / NUM l size NUM { f rsub { size NUM { NUM } } = v rsub { size NUM { NOUN } } / λ rsub { size NUM { NUM } } = v rsub { size NUM { NOUN } } / NUM ` " l " } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , the NOUN or NOUN are NOUN of the fundamental frequency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as seen in [ link ] , the first NOUN can easily be calculated since λ NUM = l λ NUM = l size NUM { λ rsub { size NUM { NUM } } = l } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the physical phenomenon of sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sound is a wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> real NOUN behave somewhat differently from how they are VERB using the thin lens NOUN , producing NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a NOUN in an image . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the lowest ADJ frequency is called the fundamental , while all higher ADJ frequencies are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all ADJ frequencies are integral NOUN of the fundamental , and they are collectively called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fundamental is the first NOUN , the first NOUN is the second ADJ , and so on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the reason is that each NOUN produces a ADJ set of frequencies and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we call our perception of these NOUN of frequencies and NOUN tone quality , or more commonly the NOUN of the sound . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is more difficult to VERB NOUN perception to physical quantities than it is for NOUN or NOUN perception . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> franklin wrote in his NOUN and books that he could see the effects of electric charge but did not understand what caused the phenomenon . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today we have the advantage of VERB that normal matter is made of atoms , and that atoms contain positive and negative charges , usually in equal amounts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons VERB its positive nucleus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nucleus is positive due to the presence of ADV charged protons . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some of the electrons in NOUN and similar NOUN are not bound to individual atoms or sites in the material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively ADV through it is called a conductor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN in the leaves of the charged NOUN VERB them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ force has a horizontal component that results in the leaves moving apart as well as a vertical component that is VERB by the gravitational force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> science includes such diverse fields as NOUN , biology , computer NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , physics , NOUN , and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , a NOUN of natural PROPN might contain any of the items listed above . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ reason , the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to ADJ reasoning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ reasoning is a form of ADJ thinking that uses a general principle or law to VERB specific results . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from those general principles , a scientist can VERB and predict the specific results that would be ADJ as long as the general principles are ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each experiment will have NUM or more variables and NUM or more controls . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the NOUN that is VERB about . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , applied science or “ technology , ” VERB to use science to VERB real - world problems , making it possible , for example , to improve a NOUN NOUN , find a NOUN for a particular disease , or save animals VERB by a natural NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in applied science , the problem is usually defined for the researcher . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this structure is sometimes called the “ PROPN ” NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are usually ADJ and reference NOUN as well as an ADJ ( a ADJ NOUN ) at the beginning of the paper . there might be additional NOUN depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published ; for example , some review papers require an NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate NOUN of the substances used , and the method and techniques used by the researchers to VERB data . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN should be ADJ enough to allow another researcher to VERB the experiment and obtain similar results , but it does not have to be ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , the NOUN section VERB the importance of the experimental NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the scientific paper almost ADV VERB NUM or more scientific questions that were stated , any good research should lead to more questions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some cells contain NOUN of macromolecules surrounded by membranes ; these are called organelles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organelles are small structures that exist within cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organs are NOUN of tissues VERB together VERB a common function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for instance , the circulatory system VERB blood through the body and to and from the lungs ; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organisms are individual living NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , each tree in a NOUN is an organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the evolution of various life forms on earth can be VERB in a ADJ tree ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on NOUN and differences in genetic or physical traits or both . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ tree is composed of nodes and branches . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another field of biological study , NOUN , studies the biology of the nervous system , and although it is considered a branch of biology , it is also recognized as an ADJ field of study known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of its ADJ nature , this NOUN studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular , cellular , developmental , medical , and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an atom is composed of NUM regions : the nucleus , which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons , and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in NOUN around the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> atoms contain protons , electrons , and neutrons , among other ADJ particles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the number of protons VERB an element ’s atomic number and is used to distinguish NUM element from another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the number of neutrons is variable , resulting in NOUN , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some elements — such as carbon , NOUN , and NOUN — have naturally occurring NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature : they may be gases , NOUN , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> elements also have specific chemical NOUN , the ability to combine and to ADV bond with each other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ shell has a maximum of NUM electrons but the next NUM electron NOUN can each have a maximum of NUM electrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as the ADJ rule , which states , with the exception of the ADJ shell , that atoms are more stable ADV when they have NUM electrons in their NOUN shell , the outermost electron shell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples of some neutral atoms and their electron NOUN are shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> chemical reactions occur when NUM or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when VERB atoms are broken apart . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules ( each atom remains VERB to at least NUM other atom ) , in this reaction only hydrogen NOUN and water are representatives of compounds : they contain atoms of more than NUM type of element . <sent_end> <sent_begin> molecular oxygen , on the other hand , as shown in [ link ] , consists of NUM ADV VERB oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a PROPN molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the oxygen atoms in an NOUN molecule are VERB by a double bond . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the NOUN of products and reactants are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this back and ADV continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs — a state called equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these situations of ADJ reactions are often VERB by a chemical equation with a double ADJ NOUN VERB ADP both the reactants and products . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> negative ions are formed by VERB electrons and are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are VERB by their ADJ name being VERB to end in “ PUNCT ” : the NOUN of NOUN is called NOUN , and the NOUN of NOUN is called NOUN , for example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> certain NOUN are referred to in NOUN as NOUN ( including sodium , NOUN , and calcium ) , ions necessary for nerve NOUN NOUN , muscle NOUN and water balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN provide these ions to VERB those lost from the body via VERB during exercise . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more ADJ to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen ’s electrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus oxygen has a higher NOUN than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the NOUN of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms , giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another way of VERB this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic NOUN , creating a major force in combination . <sent_end> <sent_begin> hydrogen bonds are also responsible for VERB together the dna double helix . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like hydrogen bonds , van PROPN PROPN interactions are weak NOUN or interactions between molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> van PROPN PROPN NOUN can occur between any NUM or more molecules and are dependent on ADJ NOUN of the electron NOUN , which are not always ADJ around an atom . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> water ’s high heat capacity is a property caused by hydrogen NOUN among water molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> water has the highest specific heat capacity of any NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> specific heat is defined as the amount of heat NUM NOUN of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by NUM degree PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eventually , as water VERB its NOUN point of NUM NOUN PROPN ( NUM NOUN PROPN ) , the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules , and the kinetic energy ( motion ) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even when below its NOUN point , water ’s individual molecules VERB enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and VERB : this process is known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before it VERB , the water forms a NOUN - like shape above the NOUN of the glass . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this water can VERB above the glass because of the property of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , water molecules are VERB to each other ( because of hydrogen NOUN ) , keeping the molecules together at the liquid - gas ( water - air ) NOUN , although there is no more room in the glass . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is because the water molecules are VERB to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore VERB to it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of NOUN is called capillary action , and is illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids ( rna and dna ) , carbohydrates , and lipids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the macromolecules are a NOUN of organic molecules ( any carbon - containing liquid , solid , or gas ) that are especially important for life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so far , the NOUN we have discussed have been ADJ NOUN , which consist of linear NOUN of carbon atoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another type of NOUN , ADJ NOUN , consists of closed NOUN of carbon atoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ring structures are found in NOUN , sometimes with the presence of double bonds , which can be seen by VERB the structure of PROPN to NOUN in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> structural NOUN ( like NOUN and PROPN shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the NOUN of their ADJ bonds : both molecules have NUM NOUN and NUM NOUN ( PROPN ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , due to their different chemical properties , NOUN is VERB for use as a NOUN for NOUN NOUN and NOUN , whereas PROPN is VERB for use as a NOUN and a NOUN in NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , on the other hand , have similar NOUN of their ADJ bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the simple molecule NOUN ( PROPN ) , the NUM NOUN groups ( PROPN ) can be on either side of the double ADJ bond central to the molecule , as illustrated in [ link ] b . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this carbon NOUN is formed by NOUN and/or NOUN of carbon atoms with the ADJ NOUN of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> molecules with other elements in their carbon NOUN are VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN combine with each other using ADJ bonds to form larger molecules known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in doing so , NOUN release water molecules as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> carbohydrates are , in fact , an essential part of our NOUN ; NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN are all natural sources of carbohydrates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbohydrates provide energy to the body , particularly through glucose , a simple sugar that is a component of NOUN and an NOUN in many ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans , animals , and plants . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN ( X = “ NUM ” ) form when NUM NOUN undergo a NOUN reaction ( also known as a NOUN reaction or NOUN synthesis ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during this process , the NOUN group of NUM NOUN VERB with the hydrogen of another NOUN , releasing a molecule of water and forming a ADJ bond . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely ADJ in nature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is because they are NOUN that include mostly ADJ carbon – carbon or carbon – hydrogen bonds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the NOUN chain contains a double bond , the fatty acid is said to be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ acid is an example of an ADJ fatty acid ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the ADJ nature of NOUN , they prevent water from VERB on the surface ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> proteins are NUM of the most ADJ organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> proteins may be structural , regulatory , ADJ , or ADJ ; they may serve in transport , storage , or membranes ; or they may be NOUN or enzymes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> protein shape is critical to its function , and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> changes in temperature , NOUN , and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein , leading to loss of function , known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all proteins are made up of different NOUN of the same NUM types of amino acids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the ADJ hormone insulin has NUM polypeptide NOUN , a and b , and they are linked together by ADJ bonds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the unique NUM - dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its ADJ structure ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the NOUN of life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they carry the genetic NOUN of a cell and carry NOUN for the functioning of the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the primary structure of a NOUN is NUM carbon - nitrogen NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN are classified as NOUN which have a single carbon - nitrogen ring as their primary structure ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each of these basic carbon - nitrogen NOUN has different functional groups attached to it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to give you a sense of cell size , a typical human red blood cell is about NUM NOUN of a NOUN or NUM NOUN ( VERB as NUM NOUN ) in diameter ; the head of a NOUN of is about NUM NOUN of a NOUN ( NUM NOUN ) in diameter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that means about NUM red blood cells could fit on the head of a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most student NOUN are classified as light NOUN ( [ link ] a ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> visible light passes and is ADJ through the lens system to enable the NOUN to see the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> like prokaryotes , eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane ( [ link ] ) , a NOUN NOUN with embedded proteins that VERB the internal NOUN of the cell from its surrounding environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a NOUN molecule with NUM fatty acid NOUN and a phosphate - containing group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> typically , the nucleus is the most prominent NOUN in a cell ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nucleus ( ADJ = nuclei ) houses the cell ’s dna and VERB the synthesis of NOUN and proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let ’s look at it in more detail ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN understand NOUN , it is ADJ to first consider chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of dna , the ADJ material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you may remember that in prokaryotes , dna is organized into a single circular chromosome . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when viewed through an electron microscope , NOUN appear either as NOUN ( PROPN ) or single , ADJ NOUN that VERB ADV in the cytoplasm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if you look at [ link ] b , you will see that plant cells each have a large central NOUN that VERB most of the area of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the central NOUN plays a key role in VERB the cell ’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> have you ever VERB that if you VERB to water a plant for a few days , it VERB ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> intermediate NOUN have no role in cell movement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their function is ADV structural . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when present , the cell has just NUM NOUN or a few NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NOUN ( singular = NOUN ) are present , however , many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are short , hair - like structures that are used to move entire cells ( such as NOUN ) or substances along the outer surface of the cell ( for example , the NOUN of cells lining the ADJ tubes that move the NOUN toward the NOUN , or NOUN lining the cells of the ADJ NOUN that NOUN NOUN matter and move it toward your NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN is a ADJ NOUN between NUM adjacent animal cells ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cells are held ADV against each other by proteins ( ADV NUM proteins called PROPN and PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN form ADJ connections between adjacent animal cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the explanation proposed by PROPN and PROPN is called the fluid ADJ model . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the model has evolved somewhat over time , but it still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ or “ water - VERB ” areas of these molecules ( which look like a collection of NOUN in an NOUN ’s NOUN of the model ) ( [ link ] ) are in contact with the ADJ fluid both inside and outside the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ , or water - VERB molecules , tend to be non - polar . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they interact with other non - polar molecules in chemical reactions , but generally do not interact with polar molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> peripheral proteins are found on the ADJ and interior surfaces of membranes , attached either to integral proteins or to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> peripheral proteins , along with integral proteins , may serve as enzymes , as structural NOUN for the fibers of the NOUN , or as part of the cell ’s recognition sites . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a physical space in which there is a range of NOUN of a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB transport <sent_end> <sent_begin> in VERB transport , also called VERB diffusion , materials VERB across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to VERB into the cell without VERB cellular energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> passage through the NOUN allows polar compounds to avoid the ADJ central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are NOUN proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> imagine a NOUN with a ADJ membrane VERB the NUM sides or NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on both sides of the membrane the water level is the same , but there are different NOUN of a VERB substance , or NOUN , that can not cross the membrane ( otherwise the NOUN on each side would be VERB by the NOUN VERB the membrane ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the volume of the solution on both sides of the membrane is the same , but the NOUN of NOUN are different , then there are different amounts of water , the NOUN , on either side of the membrane . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM terms — ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ — are used to relate the NOUN of a cell to the NOUN of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a ADJ situation , the extracellular fluid has lower NOUN than the fluid inside the cell , and water enters the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( in living systems , the point of reference is always the cytoplasm , so the NOUN NOUN means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of NOUN , or a lower NOUN , than the cell cytoplasm . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , the cell membrane VERB from the wall and VERB the cytoplasm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> plants lose NOUN pressure in this condition and VERB ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN pressure within a plant cell depends on the NOUN of the solution that it is VERB in . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this energy is VERB from atp generated through the cell ’s metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> active transport mechanisms , collectively called NOUN , work against ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> small substances ADV pass through plasma membranes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an important membrane NOUN for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or NOUN to VERB movement : there are NUM types of these proteins or NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN carries NUM specific ion or molecule . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN carries NUM different ions or molecules , both in the same direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN also carries NUM different ions or molecules , but in different directions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of these NOUN can also transport small , ADJ organic molecules like glucose . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN for NOUN , a portion of the ADV - VERB surface of the plasma membrane becomes VERB with a protein called NOUN , which VERB this section of the membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle , eventually VERB it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a variation of PROPN is called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process uses a NOUN protein , called PROPN , on the ADJ side of the plasma membrane , which VERB a similar function to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN in the plasma membrane that form the NOUN have membrane receptors and ADJ NOUN in addition to PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scientists use the term NOUN to discuss the concept of energy flow ( [ link ] ) through living systems , such as cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cellular processes such as the building and VERB down of complex molecules occur through ADJ chemical reactions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of sugars illustrates how a single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of atp , NUM to NUM molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is a ADJ pathway . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN involve the NOUN ( or NOUN ) of complex molecules into ADJ ones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the more energy that is lost by a system to its NOUN , the less ADJ and more random the system is . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists refer to the measure of NOUN or disorder within a system as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high NOUN means high disorder and low energy ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is because these bonds can release energy when broken . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds , and is released when those bonds are broken , is called chemical energy ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a negative PROPN also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants , because they gave off some free energy during the reaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> reactions that have a negative PROPN and ADV release free energy are called PROPN reactions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> think : PROPN means energy is VERB the system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a small energy input is required to achieve this ADJ state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ state is called the NOUN state , and it is a high - energy , ADJ state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , NOUN molecules do n’t last long in their NOUN state , but very quickly VERB to the next steps of the chemical reaction . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high - energy state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both bonds that link the NOUN are equally high - energy bonds ( PROPN bonds ) that , when broken , release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these high - energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third ( or NOUN and NOUN ) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , increasing or VERB the temperature outside of an ADJ range can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well ADJ to bind NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high temperatures will eventually cause enzymes , like other biological molecules , to VERB , a process that changes the natural properties of a substance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , the NOUN of the local environment can also affect enzyme function . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding VERB a ADJ change that reduces the NOUN of the enzyme for its substrate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of NOUN is called ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most ADV regulated enzymes are made up of more than NUM polypeptide , meaning that they have more than NUM protein NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN reaction VERB an electron from an atom in a compound , and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because NOUN and reduction usually occur together , these pairs of reactions are called NOUN reduction reactions , or ADJ reactions . electrons and energy <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a phosphate group is removed from an intermediate NOUN in the pathway , and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available PROPN molecule , producing atp ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this very direct method of NOUN is called substrate - level NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar , glucose . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the first step in the NOUN of glucose to VERB energy for cellular metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nearly all living organisms carry out NOUN as part of their metabolism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the second step of NOUN , an NOUN VERB NOUN into NUM of its NOUN , NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is an enzyme that VERB the NOUN of a molecule into NUM of its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( this change from NOUN to PROPN allows the ADJ split of the sugar into NUM NUM - carbon molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the presence of oxygen , PROPN PROPN VERB its NOUN group to a NUM - carbon molecule , PROPN , to form PROPN , a NUM - carbon molecule with NUM NOUN groups ; this pathway will VERB the NOUN of the ADJ energy from what began as a glucose molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this single pathway is called by different names : the ADJ acid cycle ( for the first intermediate formed — ADJ acid , or NOUN — when NOUN VERB to the PROPN ) , the PROPN cycle ( since ADJ acid or NOUN and PROPN are PROPN acids ) , and the PROPN cycle , after PROPN PROPN , who first identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in NOUN flight muscles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) is so named because the NOUN attached to its ADJ surface give it a VERB appearance when viewed through an electron microscope ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , which is derived from NOUN NOUN , also called NOUN , is NUM of several ADJ groups or NOUN - factors in the electron transport chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ group is a non - protein molecule required for the activity of a protein . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ groups are organic or inorganic , non - ADJ molecules bound to a protein that VERB its function ; ADJ groups include NOUN - enzymes , which are the ADJ groups of enzymes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> processes that use an organic molecule to VERB PROPN from PROPN are collectively referred to as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because they use light to VERB their own food , they are called PROPN ( literally , “ self - NOUN using light ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed NOUN ( “ other NOUN ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a third very interesting group of bacteria VERB sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by VERB energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated NOUN called NOUN ( singular : NOUN ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are typically located on the NOUN of the leaf , which helps to VERB water loss . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> within the NOUN are VERB , NOUN - shaped structures called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> embedded in the NOUN membrane is chlorophyll , a NOUN ( molecule that VERB light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN membrane VERB an internal space called the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> photosynthesis takes place in NUM ADJ stages : the light - dependent reactions and the light independent - reactions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the light - dependent reactions , energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the light - independent reactions , the chemical energy VERB during the light - dependent reactions drive the NOUN of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scientists VERB the various types of ADJ energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the difference between NOUN VERB to the amount of energy carried by them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you may recall that NUM x NUM = NUM , NUM x NUM = NUM , and NUM x NUM = NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB these facts is NOUN . another strategy is VERB : you organize information into ADJ NOUN or NOUN ( PROPN , powers , & PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is useful when trying to remember information like NOUN and NOUN numbers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> use ADJ NOUN : in a famous article , PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long - term memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their theory is called levels of processing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if we want to remember a piece of information , we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we refer to these NOUN throughout the chapter . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> not all ADJ events are universal , meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> biological NOUN , such as NOUN , tend to be universal , but social NOUN , such as the age when children begin formal NOUN , are not necessarily universal ; instead , they affect most individuals in a particular culture ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in developed countries children begin school around NUM or NUM years old , but in developing countries , like PROPN , children often enter school at an ADJ age , if at all ( PROPN , NUM ; united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization [ PROPN ] , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how do nature and VERB influence development ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> are we who we are because of nature ( biology and NOUN ) , or are we who we are because of NOUN ( our environment and culture ) ? this ADJ question is known in psychology as the nature versus VERB debate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> humans are diverse , and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with NUM another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ example is that of PROPN martin , a NUM - year - old african american who was VERB by a NOUN NOUN NOUN , george PROPN , in a ADV white NOUN in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN grew ADJ of the NOUN VERB in a NOUN and VERB martin . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage NOUN , took freud ’s theory and modified it as ADJ theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s ADJ development theory VERB the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN said that children develop NOUN to help them understand the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are concepts ( mental models ) that are used to help us VERB and VERB information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by the time children have reached NOUN , they have created NOUN for almost everything . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first stage is the ADJ stage , which VERB from birth to about NUM years old . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during this stage , children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN NOUN was cut into NUM NOUN , so PROPN VERB his sister that he VERB more NOUN than she did . <sent_end> <sent_begin> children in this stage can not perform mental NOUN because they have not developed an understanding of conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something , it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> children in the ADJ ADJ stage also understand the principle of NOUN , which means that objects can be changed and then VERB back to their original form or condition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> take , for example , water that you VERB into the short , fat glass : you can VERB water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount ( minus a NOUN of NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after VERB people with this and various other moral NOUN , PROPN VERB people ’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , an individual VERB from the capacity for pre - ADJ NOUN ( before age NUM ) to the capacity for ADJ NOUN ( early NOUN ) , and toward VERB post - ADJ NOUN ( once formal ADJ thought is VERB ) , which only a few fully achieve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN topics ( those that VERB to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social PROPN ( the ways in which we think about PRON and others ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ topics ( those that VERB to NOUN and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , NOUN and close relationships , and group processes and NOUN relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , PROPN holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an internal factor is an NOUN of a person and includes personality traits and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social psychologists have VERB to take the ADJ perspective , whereas personality psychologists have VERB the NOUN perspective . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , a person ’s NOUN is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , people from a ADJ culture , that is , a culture that focuses on ADJ relationships with others , such as family , NOUN , and community ( [ link ] ) , are less likely to VERB the fundamental NOUN error ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people from ADJ cultures , such as some ADJ cultures , are more likely to VERB relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual . <sent_end> <sent_begin> activities such as ( a ) VERB a NOUN , ( b ) VERB out , and ( c ) VERB a NOUN engage people in a group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can understand self - serving bias by VERB more deeply into NOUN , a belief about the cause of a result . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM model of NOUN VERB NUM main NOUN : NOUN of control ( internal versus external ) , stability ( stable versus ADJ ) , and NOUN ( ADJ versus ADJ ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a mother and NOUN ’s dna is passed on to the child at the moment of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs when sperm VERB an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a zygote begins as a NUM - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after the zygote VERB for about NUM days and has NUM cells , it VERB down the ADJ tubes and NOUN itself in the lining of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> upon NOUN , this ADJ - cellular organism is called an embryo . <sent_end> <sent_begin> now blood vessels grow , forming the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is any environmental NOUN — biological , chemical , or physical — that causes damage to the developing embryo or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are different types of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and VERB objects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ motor skills focus on the muscles in our NOUN , NOUN , and eyes , and enable NOUN of small actions ( e.g. , VERB a NOUN , writing with a NOUN , and using a NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in social and emotional development , forming healthy NOUN is very important and is the major social NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> attachment is a long - standing connection or bond with others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> developmental psychologists are interested in how NOUN reach this NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with ADJ attachment , the child is ADJ to the parent , does not use the parent as a secure base , and does not care if the parent leaves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB to the parent the same way she VERB to a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN developed and VERB a theory describing NUM NOUN NOUN : ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with the ADJ style , the parent gives ADJ demands and consistent limits , VERB NOUN and NOUN , and VERB to the child ’s point of view . <sent_end> <sent_begin> parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with the ADJ style of NOUN , the parents are ADJ , ADJ , and sometimes referred to as ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they do n’t respond to the child ’s needs and make relatively few demands . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while the sequence of physical changes in NOUN is predictable , the NOUN and NOUN of NOUN vary widely . <sent_end> <sent_begin> several physical changes occur during NOUN , such as PROPN and PROPN , the NOUN of the adrenal glands and sex glands , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> secondary sexual characteristics are physical NOUN of sexual NOUN that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of NOUN and NOUN in NOUN , and development of facial hair and a VERB voice in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN experience NOUN , the beginning of ADJ periods , usually around NUM – NUM years old , and NOUN experience PROPN , the first NOUN , around NUM – NUM years old . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social NOUN and social support . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as we get older , ADJ NOUN theory suggests that our social support and NOUN VERB in number , but remain as close , if not more close than in our earlier years ( PROPN , NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this shared knowledge comes from social norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a social NOUN is a group ’s NOUN of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are VERB to behave and think ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how are we expected to act ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s PROPN prison experiment <sent_end> <sent_begin> the famous PROPN prison experiment , conducted by social psychologist PROPN PROPN and his NOUN at PROPN university , demonstrated the power of social roles , social norms , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN of NUM , an NOUN was placed in a california NOUN VERB for male NOUN to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is our NOUN of a person , an idea , or an object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we have attitudes for many things VERB from products that we might VERB up in the NOUN to people around the world to political policies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the military example VERB the observation that a difficult initiation into a group VERB us to like the group more , due to the NOUN of effort . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we do not want to have VERB time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the topic of NOUN has been NUM of the most ADV VERB areas in social psychology ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the second world war , PROPN PROPN ADV VERB NOUN for the u.s. army . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after the war , PROPN continued his NOUN of NOUN at PROPN university . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the central route is NOUN driven and uses data and facts to VERB people of an argument ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a car company seeking to VERB you to purchase their model will VERB the car ’s safety features and NOUN economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM study , a group of participants was shown a series of VERB line NOUN of different NOUN : a , b , and c ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what factors make a person more likely to VERB to group pressure ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> research shows that the size of the majority , the presence of another NOUN , and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key NOUN on NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ social influence , people VERB to the group NOUN to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , with ADJ social influence , people VERB because they believe the group is ADJ and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what type of social influence was operating in the PROPN NOUN studies ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> several variations of the original PROPN experiment were conducted to test the NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when certain features of the situation were changed , participants were less likely to continue to VERB NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social NOUN occurs when an individual VERB better when an NOUN is VERB than when the individual VERB the behavior alone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this typically occurs when people are VERB a task for which they are skilled . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the field of i - NOUN psychology can be divided into NUM broad areas ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) : industrial , organizational , and human factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and VERB individuals for their ability to meet those requirements . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , once employees are VERB , industrial psychology studies and develops ways to VERB , VERB , and respond to those NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scott was NUM of the first psychologists to apply psychology to NOUN , management , and NOUN selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , scott published NUM books : the theory of PROPN and psychology of PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology , the field of human factors psychology was also developing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN was an NOUN who saw that if one could VERB the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM he put forward his theory in a book VERB , the principles of scientific management ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these differences may be difficult for some people to VERB , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prejudice is a negative NOUN and NOUN toward an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a particular social group ( PROPN , NUM ; brown , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prejudice is common against people who are members of an ADJ cultural group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a specific racial group ( such as toward african americans , PROPN americans , PROPN , native americans , european americans ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what are some stereotypes of various racial or ADJ groups ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another form of prejudice is NOUN : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like NOUN , NOUN is a widespread prejudice in u.s. society that is VERB by many people ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when we hold a NOUN about a person , we have expectations that he or she will VERB that NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a self - VERB NOUN is an NOUN held by a person that VERB his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these groups serve as our in - groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an in - group is a group that we identify with or see PRON as VERB to . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as ADV different from us . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this often happens by VERB an out - group for the problem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the act of VERB an out - group when the in - group experiences NOUN or is VERB from VERB a goal ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with NOUN to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a NOUN is an example of hostile aggression . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by VERB a goal and does not necessarily involve ADJ to cause pain ( PROPN , NUM ) ; a contract NOUN who VERB for hire NOUN instrumental aggression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although there is not NUM single personality NOUN for who becomes a NOUN and who becomes a NOUN of NOUN ( apa , NUM ) , researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being VERB ( PROPN , NUM ) : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> based on this case , researchers PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) described a phenomenon called the NOUN effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN effect is a phenomenon in which a NOUN or NOUN does not VERB to help a NOUN or person in distress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , they just VERB what is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> research suggests there are many other reasons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is people ’s NOUN to help others even if the costs VERB the benefits of helping . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , people acting in ADJ ways may VERB the personal costs associated with helping ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once we form relationships with people , we VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the give and take in relationships . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we contribute to relationships , but we expect to receive benefits as well . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) states that a healthy relationship will have all NUM components of love — NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN — which is described as ADJ love ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , different aspects of love might be more ADJ at different life stages . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to social exchange theory , we act as ADJ economists in keeping a NOUN of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and VERB a relationship with others ( [ link ] ) ( PROPN & van PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you might be VERB if psychology research can VERB you how to VERB in a job NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you can imagine , most research is concerned with the NOUN ’s interest in VERB the most appropriate candidate for the job , a goal that makes sense for the candidate too . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> title PROPN of the civil rights act of NUM makes it illegal to treat individuals ADV because of their race or color of their skin : an NOUN can not VERB based on skin color , hair NOUN , or other ADJ characteristics , which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity , in NOUN , benefits , NOUN , or NOUN of employees . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN discrimination act of NUM VERB the civil rights act ; it VERB job ( e.g. , employment , pay , and NOUN ) discrimination of a woman because she is ADJ as long as she can perform the work required . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in organizational psychology , the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction , different NOUN of management , different NOUN of leadership , organizational culture , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is an increasingly common response to a business ’s VERB failure to achieve profit goals , and it involves VERB off a significant percentage of the company ’s employees . <sent_end> <sent_begin> industrial - organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of NOUN : how the news is delivered to employees ( both those being let go and those NOUN ) , how laid - off employees are supported ( e.g. , separation NOUN ) , and how ADJ employees are supported . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a significant portion of i - NOUN research focuses on management and human relations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) combined scientific management ( a theory of management that VERB and VERB NOUN with the main NOUN of VERB economic efficiency , especially labor productivity ) and human relations into the NOUN of leadership behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his theory VERB out NUM different NOUN called theory x and theory y . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) VERB and developed the concepts of ADJ leadership versus ADJ leadership NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ leadership , the focus is on NOUN and organizational goals , which are achieved through a system of NOUN and NOUN ( i.e. , transactions ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ leaders maintain the status X : they are NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each company and organization has an organizational culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organizational culture VERB the values , NOUN , NOUN , norms , and interactions among its employees . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is how an organization is run , how it VERB , and how it makes decisions — the industry in which the organization VERB may have an influence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> equal employment opportunity commission ( PROPN . ) provides the following NOUN of sexual NOUN : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> whereas the NUM other areas of i - NOUN psychology focus on the NOUN between the worker and NOUN , group , or organization , human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker ’s interaction with a machine , work NOUN , information NOUN , and the local environment , such as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , human factors psychology has NOUN in both psychology and NOUN ; this is VERB in the early contributions of PROPN PROPN ( psychologist and NOUN ) and her NOUN PROPN PROPN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN are referred to as response - based NOUN because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the NOUN PROPN PROPN , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , ADJ or ADJ conditions ” ( PROPN , NUM , NOUN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it VERB stress ADV in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM kinds of NOUN of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a primary NOUN involves NOUN about the degree of potential NOUN or threat to well - being that a stressor might VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a stressor would likely be VERB as a threat if one VERB that it could lead to some kind of NOUN , loss , or other negative NOUN ; conversely , a stressor would likely be VERB as a challenge if one VERB that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a person at this stress level is ADV at the top of his NOUN , meaning he VERB fully VERB , focused , and can work with ADJ effort and maximum efficiency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but when stress VERB this ADJ level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and ADJ , or what PROPN termed distress ( from the latin NOUN = “ bad ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people who reach this level of stress feel VERB out ; they are ADJ , ADJ , and their performance begins to decline . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> your heart VERB to VERB and VERB up , you begin to VERB ADV and VERB , you get NOUN in your stomach , and your muscles become ADJ , VERB you to take some kind of direct action . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight - or - flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly VERB by NOUN of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the general NOUN syndrome , shown in [ link ] , consists of NUM stages : ( 1 ) NOUN reaction , ( 2 ) stage of resistance , and ( 3 ) stage of NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ; NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN reaction describes the body ’s immediate reaction upon VERB a ADJ situation or NOUN , and it is roughly ADJ to the fight - or - flight response described by PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during an NOUN reaction , you are VERB to a stressor , and your body NOUN you with a NOUN of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to VERB the situation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of NUM systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the ADJ - pituitary - adrenal ( PROPN ) axis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a person first VERB something as stressful ( PROPN ’s NOUN reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of NOUN from the adrenal glands . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ perspective looks at you , your behaviors , and your symptoms in the context of your culture and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN is an ADJ - old ADJ male from a traditional family . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1960s , NOUN thomas PROPN and richard PROPN wanted to VERB the link between life NOUN and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life NOUN are stressful , whether these events are ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they developed the social PROPN PROPN scale ( PROPN ) , consisting of NUM life events that require varying NOUN of personal NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> potential NOUN do not always involve major life events . <sent_end> <sent_begin> daily NOUN — the minor NOUN and NOUN that are part of our everyday lives ( e.g. , NOUN hour NOUN , lost NOUN , ADJ NOUN , ADJ NOUN , NOUN with NOUN or family ) — can build on one another and leave us just as VERB as life change events ( [ link ] ) ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this helps explain why NOUN rates tend to be high . <sent_end> <sent_begin> about NUM % – NUM % of individuals VERB , which means they return to VERB drugs and/or alcohol after a period of NOUN ( national institute on drug abuse [ PROPN ] , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this section , we will discuss stress and illness . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as stress researcher robert PROPN ( NUM ) describes , <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in addition , the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this situation is referred to as NOUN , the VERB NOUN of the immune system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when people experience NOUN , they become ADJ to any number of NOUN , illness , and diseases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB NOUN can VERB or block cell division , which includes growth and NOUN of new cells , ADV leading to more rapid aging ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the study , researchers compared NOUN NOUN in the white blood cells in NOUN of ADV ADJ children to those of NOUN of healthy children ( PROPN et NOUN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of ADV ADJ children would be expected to experience more stress than would NOUN of healthy children . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these individuals tend to be ADV driven NOUN who are VERB with NOUN and always seem to be in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN and PROPN , these individuals exhibit type a behavior pattern ; those who are more ADJ and laid - back were characterized as type b ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a sample of type as and type PROPN , PROPN and PROPN were ADJ to VERB that heart disease was over NUM times more ADJ among the type as than the type PROPN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) , who found that the death rate among ADJ patients with PROPN ( an ADJ term for depression ) was NUM times higher than that of the population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ study in the late 1970s VERB at over NUM ADJ - ADJ NOUN in PROPN , finding a nearly NUM % increase in NOUN from heart disease among these patients compared with the general ADJ population ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the therapist VERB the NOUN about NOUN , NOUN , and what to expect in treatment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN means the therapist can not VERB ADJ NOUN to any third party unless VERB or VERB by law to do so . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the NOUN , the therapist and NOUN will work together to discuss treatment goals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> couples therapy involves NUM people in an ADJ relationship who are having NOUN and are trying to VERB them ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN may be VERB , VERB , VERB , or married . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ family therapy , the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be VERB with in a relatively short amount of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> typically , the therapist would VERB what happens in the therapy NOUN and design a detailed approach to VERB each member ’s problem ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN was developed by PROPN freud and was the first form of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it was the dominant ADJ technique in the early ADJ century , but it has since VERB significantly in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> freud suggested that during this patient - therapist relationship , the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist — ADV positive feelings , ADV negative feelings . <sent_end> <sent_begin> freud called this NOUN : the patient VERB all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient ’s other relationships to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN is VERB a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , NOUN help their patients look into their past to VERB ADJ feelings . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in behavior therapy , a therapist VERB principles of learning to help clients change ADJ behaviors — rather than VERB deeply into one ’s unconscious . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM NOUN techniques are ADJ conditioning and exposure therapy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ conditioning uses an ADJ stimulus to stop an ADJ behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN apply this technique to VERB ADJ behaviors , such as NOUN , NOUN NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes , it ’s too ADJ , expensive , or ADJ to re - create anxiety - producing situations , so a therapist might VERB ADJ reality exposure therapy by using a NOUN to help VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking , NOUN ( fear of ADJ spaces ) , PROPN ( fear of NOUN ) , and post - ADJ stress disorder ( PROPN ) , a NOUN and stressor - related disorder ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cognitive therapy was developed by NOUN PROPN PROPN in the 1960s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his initial focus was on depression and how a NOUN ’s self - VERB NOUN served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life ( PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so it makes sense that the goal of ADJ therapy is to help people become more self - aware and VERB of themselves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast to NOUN , ADJ NOUN focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in active NOUN , the therapist VERB , VERB , and VERB what the NOUN VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN also practice what rogers called ADJ positive regard , which involves not VERB clients and simply VERB them for who they are . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rogers ( NUM ) also felt that NOUN should demonstrate NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN toward their clients because this helps people become more ADJ of themselves , which results in personal growth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we learned in the previous section , stress — especially if it is ADJ — takes a NOUN on our bodies and can have ADV negative health NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when we experience events in our lives that we VERB as stressful , it is essential that we use effective VERB strategies to VERB our stress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these efforts may include VERB , VERB , or VERB PRON from the problem , or positive NOUN with others ( “ i VERB not as bad off as she is ” ) , or seeking something positive in a negative event ( “ now that i VERB been VERB , i can sleep in for a few days ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some cases , emotion - focused NOUN strategies involve NOUN , ADV the stressor is VERB differently ( and somewhat self - ADV ) without changing its ADJ level of threat ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a person VERB to federal prison who VERB , “ this will give PRON a great chance to network with others , ” is using NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> building strong ADJ relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , VERB individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , NOUN , and fear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social support can be thought of as the ADJ impact of NOUN , family , and NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social support can take many forms , including NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , emotional NOUN , and ADJ assistance ( such as financial help ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> beyond having a sense of control and VERB social support NOUN , there are numerous other means by which we can VERB stress ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a common technique people use to combat stress is exercise ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is well - established that exercise , both of long ( ADJ ) and short ( ADJ ) NOUN , is beneficial for both physical and mental health ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the relaxation response approach is VERB as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal , and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another technique to combat stress , NOUN , was developed by PROPN PROPN at PROPN university in the early 1970s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a technique that uses ADJ equipment to ADV measure a person ’s ADJ and ADJ activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> measuring happiness and well - being at the societal level over time may VERB policy NOUN in determining if people are generally ADJ or ADJ , as well as when and why they might feel the way they do . <sent_end> <sent_begin> studies show that average national happiness NOUN ( over time and across countries ) relate strongly to NUM key variables : per capita ADJ domestic product ( gdp , which VERB a nation ’s economic standard of living ) , social support , freedom to make important life choices , healthy life NOUN , freedom from perceived NOUN in government and business , and NOUN ( PROPN et NOUN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN that help promote psychological well - being ( e.g. , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of NOUN , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of ADJ health outcomes ( especially VERB ADJ health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as NOUN , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to ADJ NOUN with the environment , such as happiness , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long - VERB , or trait - like ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by the ADJ century , people who were considered ADJ and unusual were placed in NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders , but the focus was VERB them from society rather than VERB their disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> often these people were VERB in ADJ NOUN , VERB , VERB to their NOUN , and had little to no contact with NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it started the process of NOUN , the NOUN of large NOUN , by providing for people to VERB in their communities and be treated ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , there were NUM ADV ADV ADJ patients VERB at public NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , there are a group of conditions that , when present , are VERB early in childhood , often before the time a child enters school . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these conditions are listed in the dsm-5 as ADJ disorders , and they involve developmental problems in personal , social , ADJ , and intellectual functioning ( apa , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , we will discuss NUM such disorders : attention PROPN NOUN disorder and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the previous NOUN of the PROPN included a NOUN of PROPN ’s disorder , generally recognized as a less severe form of ADJ disorder ; individuals VERB with PROPN ’s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong NOUN , but VERB NOUN in social interaction and social communication , such as VERB only about their special interests ( wing , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , because research has VERB to demonstrate that PROPN ’s disorder VERB ADV from ADJ disorder , the dsm-5 does not include it , which is VERB concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ( “ PROPN ’s syndrome VERB , ” NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some individuals with NOUN spectrum disorder , particularly those with better language and intellectual skills , can live and work ADV as adults . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN refers to the partial or total NOUN of some experience or event . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an individual with ADJ NOUN is unable to recall important personal information , usually following an extremely stressful or ADJ experience such as combat , natural NOUN , or being the NOUN of violence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the memory NOUN are not caused by ordinary NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term government describes the means by which a society VERB itself and VERB authority in order to VERB collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> among the goals that governments around the world seek to VERB are economic NOUN for the nation , secure national NOUN , and the safety and well - being of citizens . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the government of the united states can best be described as a republic , or representative democracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — VERB in the hands of the people . in a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , in representative governments like the united states , minority rights are protected : people can not be VERB of certain rights even if an ADJ number of people think that they should be . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , let ’s say american society decided that NOUN , people who do not believe that god exists , were ADJ and should be VERB or VERB from the country . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN of elite theory was PROPN PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in his book , the power elite , PROPN argued that government was controlled by a combination of business , military , and political NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> c . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to ADJ theory , people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their NOUN known to politicians . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these groups include such NOUN as environmental NOUN , unions , and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first amendment of the constitution gives americans the right to express their NOUN on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not VERB with this right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the fourteenth amendment , state governments must protect this right also . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the same time , neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone ’s right to free expression to VERB with someone else ’s ability to exercise his or her own rights . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN alone : the PROPN and PROPN of american community . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new york : PROPN & PROPN , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB that a decline in social capital — “ the collective value of all PUNCT social NOUN ’ [ those whom people know ] and the NOUN that arise from these NOUN to do things for each other ” — VERB this decline in membership in small , ADJ groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> INTJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , one could be sure that election results were ADJ and that the VERB candidate had in fact received the votes counted in their favor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> common cause has also advocated that the electoral college be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such NOUN were used successfully in the african american civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , the NOUN - NOUN ( and sleep - NOUN and NOUN - NOUN ) VERB by african american civil rights NOUN , which they employed successfully to VERB NOUN NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN , have been adopted today by movements such as black lives matter and VERB wall street ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other NOUN , such as VERB businesses of whose policies the NOUN VERB , are also still common . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> americans VERB NUM were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of political activity than older americans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NUM poll of more than NUM NUM young adults by PROPN university ’s institute of politics VERB that only NUM percent VERB to be ADV VERB , and fewer than NUM percent said that they VERB to any type of political organization or had VERB for a political campaign . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> “ who votes , who does n’t , and why , ” X . <sent_end> <sent_begin> political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when VERB policy or VERB how to vote on issues , capture only people ’s ADJ NOUN or beliefs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of all the political NOUN who influenced american beliefs about government , the most important is ADV john PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most significant contributions of PROPN , a ADJ - century english NOUN , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be god - given rights to life , liberty , and property . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people VERB a small portion of their freedom and VERB to be ruled in exchange for the government ’s protection of their lives , liberty , and property . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN called this ADJ agreement between a people and their government the social contract . <sent_end> <sent_begin> should government VERB people of their rights by VERB the power given to it , the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all this began to change in NUM when the seven years war between great britain and france came to an end , and great britain gained control of most of the french territory in north america . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the colonists had VERB on behalf of britain , and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to VERB on land west of the PROPN PROPN that had been taken from france . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first such tax to draw the NOUN of colonists was the stamp act , passed in NUM , which required that almost all paper goods , such as NOUN , land NOUN , NOUN , and newspapers , have revenue NOUN placed on them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN was so great that the new tax was quickly VERB , but its NOUN was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the PROPN acts ( NUM ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> new york : free press , NUM - NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this act of NOUN became known as the boston tea party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today , many who do not agree with the positions of the democratic or the republican party have organized themselves into an ADJ group VERB the tea party ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in may NUM , delegates met again in the second PROPN congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by this time , war with great britain had already begun , following NOUN between colonial NOUN and british troops at PROPN and PROPN , massachusetts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB by thomas jefferson , the declaration of independence ADV VERB the colonies ’ separation from britain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in it , jefferson ADV laid out the reasons for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many also VERB that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , a confederation was created — an NOUN in which independent , self - VERB states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ of VERB NUM ADJ national government with another , however , the NOUN of the articles of confederation created an NOUN of ADJ states held together by a weak central government . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the ADJ problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to avoid any perception of “ NOUN without representation , ” the articles of confederation allowed only state governments to VERB taxes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , virginia and PROPN VERB delegates from the other NUM states to meet in PROPN , PROPN , for the purpose of VERB the articles of confederation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , only NUM states sent representatives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM - NUM delegates VERB in PROPN in may NUM for the meeting that became known as the constitutional convention . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many wanted to VERB the role and authority of the national government but VERB creating a central government that was too powerful . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> delegates from small states VERB to this virginia plan . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another proposal , the new jersey plan , called for a ADJ legislature with NUM house , in which each state would have NUM vote . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the constitution consists of a ADJ and NUM articles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first NUM articles divide the national government into NUM branches — congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM - NOUN compromise , illustrated in [ link ] , VERB the NOUN , although not in a manner that ADV VERB anyone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for purposes of congressional NOUN , VERB states were allowed to VERB all their free population , including free african americans and NUM percent ( NUM - NOUN ) of their VERB population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> neither of these branches had existed under the articles of confederation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , congress can pass laws , but its power to do so can be VERB by the president , who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become a law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> later , in the NUM case of PROPN v. madison , the u.s. supreme court established its own authority to rule on the NOUN of laws , a process called judicial review . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all powers not ADV given to the national government , however , were intended to be VERB by the states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these powers are known as VERB powers ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as ADJ commerce ( commerce within the NOUN of a state ) and marriage . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this approach to ratification was an unusual one . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the authority ADJ in the articles of confederation and the confederation congress had VERB on the NOUN of the states , changes to the nation ’s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> john adams and thomas jefferson carried on a ADJ NOUN regarding the ratification of the constitution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the following NOUN ( VERB as written ) from a NOUN VERB march NUM , NUM , after the constitution had been ratified by NUM states but before it had been approved by all NUM , jefferson VERB his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens ’ freedoms was necessary and should be added to the constitution : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> anti - federalists VERB the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although some anti - federalists , like PROPN henry , were wealthy , most VERB the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of “ the ADJ NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this was ADV the fear of PROPN smith , a new york NOUN and NOUN , who believed that power should rest in the hands of small , VERB farmers of average wealth who “ are more ADJ , of better NOUN and less ADJ than the great . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB considerable opposition to the constitution in that state , PROPN hamilton , james madison , and john PROPN wrote a series of NOUN , beginning in NUM , VERB for a strong federal government and support of the constitution ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> later VERB as the federalist and now known as the federalist papers , these NUM - NUM NOUN were originally published in newspapers in new york and other states under the name of PROPN , a NOUN of the PROPN republic . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been VERB by ADJ men . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , PROPN VERB new PROPN in federalist no . <sent_end> <sent_begin> 2 that union had been the goal of americans since the time of the revolution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because these men would be members of a “ ADJ ” body called together only for the purpose of VERB the president and would meet in separate NOUN in each state , they would be free of NOUN and beyond the influence of the “ NOUN and NOUN ” of the voters . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , hamilton argued in federalist no . NUM , instead of being ADJ that the president would become a NOUN , americans should VERB that it was ADJ to control NUM person than it was to control many . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB to charges by anti - federalists that the constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals , the newly elected federal government VERB the issue of VERB liberties for american citizens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> james madison , a member of congress from virginia , took the lead in VERB NUM potential changes to the constitution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the bill of rights was intended to VERB the NOUN of anti - federalists that the constitution did not ADV protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of these first NUM amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the right to bear arms for protection ( second amendment ) , the right not to have to provide NOUN and provision for soldiers in NOUN ( third amendment ) , the right to a trial by NOUN ( PROPN and PROPN amendments ) , and protection from excessive NOUN and from ADJ and unusual punishment ( PROPN amendment ) are taken from the english bill of rights . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other liberties , however , do not VERB from british NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the protections for religion , speech , the press , and NOUN that are granted by the first amendment did not exist under english law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( the right to VERB the government did , however . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the supreme court , for example , has held that the PROPN amendment protects the right to privacy even though NOUN of the VERB amendments ADV VERB this right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN amendment , NUM of the first VERB to the states for ratification , VERB that states possess all powers not ADV VERB to the federal government by the constitution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN protects states ’ ADJ powers to regulate such things as marriage , NOUN , and ADJ transportation and commerce , and to pass laws VERB education and public health and safety . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital ADV than before . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the twenty - second amendment , added in NUM , limits the president to NUM terms in office , and the twenty - PROPN amendment , first VERB for ratification in NUM , VERB the implementation of laws regarding NOUN increases or decreases for members of congress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when states began to change property requirements for voters in the NOUN , many that had allowed free , property - VERB african american men to vote restricted the suffrage to white men . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the nineteenth amendment finally gave women the right to vote in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the twenty - third amendment ( NUM ) allowed NOUN of washington , dc to vote for the president . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the twenty - fourth amendment ( NUM ) VERB the use of poll taxes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many southern states had used a poll tax , a tax placed on voting , to prevent poor african americans from voting . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> american federalism also VERB to balance the forces of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we see NOUN when we cross state lines and VERB different NOUN levels , welfare NOUN requirements , and voting regulations , to name just a few . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the united states , NOUN between states and the federal government are VERB by federal courts , with the u.s. supreme court being the final NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resolution of such NOUN can preserve the NOUN of NUM level of government , as illustrated recently when the supreme court ruled that states can not VERB with the federal government ’s actions VERB to immigration . arizona v. united states , NUM u.s. _ _ ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other instances , a supreme court ruling can VERB that NOUN , as demonstrated in the NOUN when , in united states v. PROPN PROPN PROPN , the court VERB the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states , a function previously VERB ADV by the states . united states v. PROPN PROPN PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a confederation , authority is ADJ , and the central government ’s ability to act depends on the NOUN of the ADJ governments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under the articles of confederation ( the first constitution of the united states ) , states were ADJ and powerful while the national government was ADJ and weak . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because states were ADJ to give up any of their power , the national government VERB authority in the face of challenges such as VERB the war debt , VERB commercial NOUN among states , VERB trade agreements with other countries , and VERB popular NOUN that were VERB the country . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , PROPN : PROPN university press . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , when it came time to VERB the constitution , a number of states VERB that an amendment be added ADV VERB the VERB powers of the states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what these anti - federalists sought was further NOUN that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first NUM amendments ( bill of rights ) provided . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN amendment VERB the states ’ ADJ powers : “ the powers not VERB to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are VERB to the states respectively , or to the people . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , state NOUN had bills of rights , which the first congress used as the source for the first NUM amendments to the constitution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most important NOUN section NUM places on the national government VERB measures that cause the NOUN of personal liberty . <sent_end> <sent_begin> specifically , the government can not VERB the NOUN of X PROPN , which enables someone in NOUN to VERB a judge to determine whether that person ’s NOUN is legal ; pass a bill of NOUN , a legislative action VERB someone ADJ without a trial ; or VERB an NOUN post X law , which VERB an act ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bill of rights VERB and VERB these constitutional restrictions , VERB that the government can not VERB on personal freedoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> various constitutional provisions govern state - to - state relations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> article PROPN , section NUM , referred to as the full NOUN and credit clause or the NOUN clause , requires the states to VERB court decisions , public acts , and NOUN of other states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , an NOUN NOUN or NOUN ’s NOUN issued in NUM state is ADJ in any other state . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> with the ratification of the fourteenth amendment in NUM , civil liberties gained more NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , the amendment says , “ no state shall make or enforce any law which shall VERB the NOUN or NOUN of citizens of the united states , ” which is a provision that VERB the NOUN and NOUN clause in article PROPN , section NUM , of the original constitution VERB that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( to use an example from today , the punishment for NOUN by an out - of - state NOUN can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the NOUN of the provision does not VERB rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in PROPN v.

<sent_begin> because ad is ADJ , it can easily fall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , even if we start at PROPN , if ad falls , then we find PRON in what keynes termed a ADJ gap . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at PROPN in the [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ goods are things like NOUN — once you consume them , they are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall from the macroeconomic perspective that services are ADJ things consumers buy , like healthcare or NOUN . keynes identified NUM factors that affect consumption : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes , so businesses need NOUN when they purchase big NOUN items . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cost of investment thus includes the interest rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , aggregate demand is not always ADV high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> second , the NOUN may VERB only ADV to shifts in aggregate demand because of ADJ wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we will consider these NUM claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the ad / as model . the first building block of the keynesian NOUN is that NOUN occur when the level of household and business NOUN demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , if wages and prices were so ADJ that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential gdp , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic NOUN , where what happens at the ADJ level is different from and ADJ to what happens at the ADJ level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by VERB its price to increase sales . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1950s , PUNCT . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , an economist at the PROPN school of economics , was studying the keynesian ADJ framework . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , there may be a NOUN between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they VERB inflation is occurring , the NOUN VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both factors ( supply NOUN and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the PROPN curve , to shift . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the keynesian response would be ADJ fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift ad to the left . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the key policy NOUN is this : should the government focus more on long - term growth and on VERB inflation than on VERB about recession or ADJ unemployment ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> this focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run NOUN in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and keynesian economics is more useful for VERB the macroeconomic short run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let 's consider the NUM neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be VERB in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . the importance of potential gdp in the long run <sent_end>
<sent_begin> growth in gdp can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as NOUN in technology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of NOUN and equipment available to help people get work done . <sent_end> <sent_begin> compare , for example , your productivity in VERB a term paper on a NOUN to working on your NOUN with word processing NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> keynesian economists argue that if the NOUN from recession to potential gdp takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more ADJ than practical . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in response to those ADJ words of john PROPN keynes , “ in the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the NOUN takes as long as , say , NUM years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a keynesian NOUN policy would be to speed up the process and VERB the time that the ADJ are out of work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> is that the likely ADJ macroeconomic policy requires some NOUN about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to VERB aggregate demand ADV with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all VERB in a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government NOUN months to produce even ADJ NOUN of gdp so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those ADJ NOUN may be VERB substantially later . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the great economist PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) VERB up the neoclassical view of the long - term PROPN curve NOUN in a NUM speech : “ [ t ] here is always a ADJ trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model , in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a vertical PROPN curve and NUM different levels of aggregate demand , rising from PROPN to PROPN to PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , many NOUN economists believe both the keynesian and neoclassical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> robert PROPN , the PROPN NOUN in economics in NUM , described the ADJ approach in this way : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economies without money typically engage in the NOUN system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN — literally trading NUM good or service for another — is highly ADJ for trying to VERB the NOUN in a modern ADJ economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an economy without money , an exchange between NUM people would involve a double NOUN of NOUN , a situation in which NUM people each want some good or service that the other person can provide . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second , money must serve as a store of value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a NOUN system , we saw the example of the NOUN trading shoes for accounting services . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of ADJ payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so money serves all of these functions — it is a NOUN of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of ADJ payment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of NOUN NOUN became more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> countries moved ADP the use of ADJ money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN money has no ADJ value , but is declared by a government to be the legal NOUN of a country . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM NOUN of money : m1 and m2 money supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> m1 money supply includes those NOUN that are very liquid such as cash , ADJ ( demand ) deposits , and NOUN ’s NOUN m2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes m1 plus savings and time deposits , NOUN of deposits , and money market funds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> m1 money supply includes NOUN and currency in circulation — the NOUN and bills that VERB in an economy that are not held by the u.s. treasury , at the federal reserve bank , or in bank NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> closely related to currency are ADJ deposits , also known as demand deposits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , m2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily VERB the money at an automatic NOUN machine or bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to VERB in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are VERB together and VERB in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another NOUN of m2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ NUM ) NOUN of deposit ( NOUN ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the NOUN has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , VERB from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is important to note that in our definition of money , it VERB deposits that are money , not the paper check or the NOUN card . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although you can make a purchase with a credit card , it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when you make a purchase with a credit card , the credit card company immediately VERB money from its NOUN account to the seller , and at the end of the NOUN , the credit card company VERB you a bill for what you have charged that NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> banks are a critical NOUN in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then VERB them at a later date . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> banks are a financial NOUN — that is , an institution that VERB between a NOUN who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> financial NOUN include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and NOUN funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be NOUN institutions , which are institutions that VERB money deposits and then use these to make loans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all the funds VERB are VERB in NUM big NOUN , which is then VERB out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a bank ’s balance PROPN balance NOUN is an accounting tool that VERB assets and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the cash you own can be used to pay your NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a bank ’s balance NOUN VERB in much the same way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bank ’s net worth is also referred to as bank capital . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bank has assets such as cash held in its NOUN , NOUN that the bank holds at the federal reserve bank ( called “ reserves ” ) , loans that are made to NOUN , and bonds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second category of bank NOUN is bonds , which are a common mechanism for borrowing , used by the federal and local government , and also private companies , and ADJ organizations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds — typically bonds issued by the u.s. government . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the bank will be more willing to make what are called “ ADJ loans , ” which are loans that have characteristics like low or NUM down - payment , little NOUN of whether the borrower has a ADJ income , and sometimes low payments for the first year or NUM that will be followed by much higher payments after that . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some ADJ loans made in the NOUN were later VERB PROPN loans : loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated no income , no job , or assets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADJ loans were typically sold and turned into financial NOUN — but with a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea was that if losses occurred on these NOUN - VERB NOUN , certain investors would agree to take the first , say , NUM % of such losses . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , a formula exists for VERB the total of these many NOUN of NOUN in a banking system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the money ADJ formula is : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some prominent central banks around the world include the european central bank , the bank of PROPN , and the bank of england . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , the central bank is called the federal reserve — often VERB as just “ the PROPN . ” this section VERB the organization of the u.s. federal reserve and VERB the major responsibilities of a central bank . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> bank regulation is intended to maintain the NOUN of banks by VERB excessive risk . <sent_end> <sent_begin> regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are allowed to purchase u.s. treasury NOUN but , to protect NOUN , they are not VERB to VERB in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too ADJ . bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , it is a bank ’s net worth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is ADJ or ADJ , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this situation , PRON VERB their deposits first received all of their money , and those who did not VERB to the bank quickly enough , lost their money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB to the bank to VERB their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN it ’s a ADJ life , the bank NOUN , VERB by PROPN PROPN , faces a NOUN of ADJ bank NOUN who want to VERB their money , but VERB to VERB their NOUN by allowing some of them to VERB a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own NOUN that was VERB to pay for his NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to prevent this , the PROPN VERB ADJ to VERB to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from ADV else . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as the NOUN of last NOUN role . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for banks , the central bank acting as a NOUN of last NOUN helps to VERB the effect of deposit insurance and to VERB bank NOUN that they will not lose their money . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the federal open market committee ( PROPN ) makes the decisions regarding these open market NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is made up of the NUM members of the federal reserve ’s board of governors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their NOUN or on deposit with the central bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to VERB out . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves , they will have a greater amount of money available to VERB out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a monetary policy that VERB interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or ADJ monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , a monetary policy that VERB interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a ADJ monetary policy or ADJ monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN will discuss how expansionary and ADJ monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand , and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the economy is VERB a recession and high unemployment , with output below potential gdp , expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows how the federal reserve has carried out monetary policy by VERB the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the graph shows the federal funds interest rate ( remember , this interest rate is set through open market NOUN ) , the unemployment rate , and the inflation rate since NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> different NOUN of monetary policy during this period are VERB in the figure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ VERB VERB from traditional monetary policy in several key ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , it involved the PROPN purchasing long term treasury bonds , rather than short term treasury bills . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by VERB short term rates because they were already as low as they could get . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level , the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , ADJ businesses and consumers may be ADJ to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms ’ sales and employees ’ jobs are more ADJ in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> specific measurements of velocity NOUN on the definition of the money supply being used . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider the velocity of m1 , the total amount of currency in circulation and NOUN account NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , for example , m1 was $ NUM NUM and nominal gdp was $ NUM NUM , so the velocity of m1 was NUM ( $ NUM NUM / $ NUM NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but , as you can see , it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this equation must hold true , by definition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1970s , when velocity as measured by m1 VERB predictable , a number of economists , led by PROPN NOUN PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these economists argued that with the long and variable NOUN of monetary policy , and the political pressures on central NOUN , central bank monetary policies were as likely to have ADJ as to have ADJ effects . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so ADJ that many countries have VERB their central banking laws since in the NUM to have their bank practice inflation VERB , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by NUM , central banks in NUM countries , including PROPN , brazil , canada , PROPN , PROPN , mexico , new PROPN , spain , PROPN , PROPN , and the united PROPN faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be VERB certain other economic problems that are coming in the future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , from NUM to NUM during what was known as the “ NOUN - ADJ ” NOUN , the u.s. stock market , which is measured by the PROPN PROPN industrial index ( which includes NUM very large companies from across the u.s. economy ) , nearly VERB in value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of NUM from NUM to NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at a broader level , some economists VERB about a NOUN cycle , where “ NOUN ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” when economic times are good , banks and the financial NOUN are ADJ to VERB , and people and firms are ADJ to borrow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money ADJ — a process of loans being made , money being VERB , and more loans being made . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in good economic times , this NOUN of NOUN VERB the NOUN of economic growth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes small economies use the currency of an ADV larger NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN , PROPN PROPN , and PROPN have decided to VERB — that is , to use the u.s. dollar as their currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes nations share a common currency . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely ADJ , because a person or firm who demands NUM currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to get a sense of this , it is useful to consider NUM groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) NOUN VERB other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let ’s consider these categories in turn . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let ’s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth , and not take a risk that the PROPN will be worth less in u.s. dollars than it ADV is . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you can VERB , which means using a financial NOUN to protect PRON against a risk from NUM of your investments ( in this case , currency risk from the contract ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a NOUN that guarantees you a certain exchange rate NUM year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” for exchange rates , the NOUN is different . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency NOUN for more of other NOUN , it is referred to as VERB or “ VERB . ” when the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency VERB for less of other NOUN , it is referred to as VERB or “ VERB . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the ADJ dollar since NUM , shown in [ link ] ( a ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the vertical axis in [ link ] ( a ) shows the price of $ NUM in u.s. currency , measured in terms of ADJ currency . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the actual foreign exchange market , almost all of the trading for mexican NOUN is done for u.s. dollars . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what factors would cause the demand or supply to shift , thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the answer to this question is discussed in the following section . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the exchange rate that VERB the prices of ADV VERB goods across countries is called the purchasing power NOUN ( PROPN ) exchange rate . a group of economists at the international PROPN program , run by the world bank , have calculated the PROPN exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of ADV ADJ goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> foreign trade in goods and services typically involves VERB the costs of production in NUM currency while receiving NOUN from sales in another currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on NOUN to VERB and NOUN , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> banks play a ADJ role in any economy in VERB transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when most of a country ’s largest banks become ADJ simultaneously , a ADJ decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and ADJ exchange rate NOUN will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , there was a ADJ NOUN of the NOUN ( relative to the u.s. dollar ) by about NUM % and again at the end of the year in NUM also by about NUM % . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( source : federal reserve economic data ( PROPN ) PROPN ) the line 's variations represent the NOUN of exchange rates . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a soft NOUN is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in NUM direction , the central bank will VERB in the market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with a hard NOUN exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and ADJ value for the exchange rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a central bank can VERB soft NOUN and hard NOUN policies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> brazil ’s central bank can use a ADJ monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , brazil ’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another issue VERB when a central bank VERB directly in the exchange rate market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a central bank ends up in a situation where it is ADV creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like u.s. dollars or NOUN , to hold as reserves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> holding large reserves of other NOUN has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not VERB to VERB such reserves without limit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as PROPN taxes , named after james PROPN , the NUM PROPN NOUN in economics who proposed such a tax in a NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term NOUN investment while VERB long - term foreign direct investment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with NUM or more nations is also called a VERB currency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ currency approach VERB foreign exchange risk ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this chapter , we VERB fiscal policy , which was first covered in PROPN to economics PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> fiscal policy is NUM of NUM policy tools for ADJ NOUN the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while monetary policy is made by NOUN at the federal reserve , fiscal policy is made by congress and the president . the discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government VERB and spending affects aggregate demand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses ADV on the policies of the federal government . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it VERB in a year , it runs a budget surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a ADJ budget . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in NUM , the u.s. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ NUM NUM more than it collected in taxes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> together , the personal income tax and the payroll tax VERB for about NUM % of federal tax NOUN in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although personal income tax NOUN account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly NUM - NOUN of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . the income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> taxes also vary with ADJ status , family size , and other factors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a ADJ tax , meaning that people with higher NOUN pay a smaller share of their income in tax . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a share of gdp , the amount collected by these taxes has VERB nearly constant over time , from about NUM % of gdp in the 1960s to roughly NUM % by NUM , according to the ADJ congressional budget office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the government also VERB an NOUN and NOUN tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN and NOUN taxes collected about NUM % of gdp in the first decade of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand ADV in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and ADV in the case of ADJ fiscal policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the stimulus NOUN of NUM is an example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> changes in tax and spending levels can also occur ADV , due to automatic NOUN , such as unemployment insurance and food NOUN , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a ADV inflationary NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government VERB in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( PROPN ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ NUM NUM and an interest rate of NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes VERB changes that would start in the next budget year or would be VERB in gradually over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be VERB to the appropriate agencies to VERB the programs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also , the government is not a household for many reasons , NUM of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the argument of keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to VERB against the NOUN , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the NOUN of the overall economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in NUM and NUM , the u.s. government had budget NOUN , although the economy was still VERB trade deficits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how will this affect interest rates in financial markets ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> in [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( PROPN ) where the demand curve ( PROPN ) for financial capital VERB with the supply curve ( PROPN ) occurs at an interest rate of NUM % and an equilibrium quantity equal to NUM % of gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from NOUN to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential gdp , VERB an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may VERB with a ADJ monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by ADJ monetary policy , and the government borrowing might VERB out a great deal of private investment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential gdp , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might VERB with expansionary monetary policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely VERB by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little VERB out of private investment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , even a central bank can not VERB the overall message of the national savings and investment identity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the theory that rational private households might shift their saving to VERB government saving or borrowing is known as ADJ NOUN because the idea has intellectual roots in the NOUN of the early nineteenth - century economist david PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if ADJ NOUN holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget NOUN would be completely VERB by a VERB change in private saving . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , banks in PROPN borrow in a widely used currency like u.s. dollars or NOUN , then convert those u.s. dollars to PROPN , and then VERB the money to NOUN in PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the value of the PROPN exchange rate VERB , then PROPN ’s banks will find it impossible to VERB the international loans that are in u.s. dollars or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are ADJ can ADV reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with PROPN in NUM , this general pattern was followed by mexico in NUM , PROPN and countries across east asia in NUM – NUM , PROPN in NUM , and PROPN in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , life NOUN at birth in many low - income regions VERB those who are more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the data also VERB that PRON can claim to have perfect standards of living . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , despite very high income levels , there is still ADJ in europe and north america . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the world ’s great economic success NOUN in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the east PROPN PROPN : south PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the list sometimes includes PROPN PROPN and PROPN , although these are often treated under international law as part of china , rather than as separate countries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for unemployment caused by a recession , the keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the monetary policy NOUN for VERB with recession is ADJ : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top NOUN , can usually VERB some reduction in interest rates . with regard to fiscal policy , the automatic NOUN discussed in government PROPN and fiscal policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic NOUN , governments in a recession should try to VERB ADJ fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of the great recession , the case for this kind of extra - ADJ expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time VERB of VERB fiscal policy , ADJ fiscal policy should be used with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the NOUN of the recession VERB that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like VERB a NOUN VERB off a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , interest rates that are not VERB mean that the NOUN of money will be paid back in VERB currency and will also lose purchasing power on NOUN that were VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a VERB economy ( the economy of a country that VERB the ability to VERB up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of NOUN over inflation that would be ADV ADJ in the high - income economies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall from the macroeconomic perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation ’s imports VERB its exports . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be VERB eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy , VERB the short - term aggregate supply curve to the left . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the result could be a NOUN of inflation and , if the federal reserve were to run a ADJ monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people sometimes VERB as if the u.s. economy , with its great size , is ADJ to this NOUN of pressure from international markets . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> world war i VERB many economic connections . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the great depression of the 1930s , many nations ADV tried to VERB their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> world war ii further VERB international trade . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall from the chapter choice in a world of NOUN that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the question each country or company should be VERB when it VERB is this : “ what do we give up to produce this good ? ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> it should be no NOUN that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from choice in a world of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the united states produces / VERB NUM NOUN of oil and NUM NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> given their current production levels , if the united states can trade an amount of NOUN fewer than NUM NOUN and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than NUM NOUN , it will gain from trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with trade , the united states can consume more of both goods than it did without NOUN and trade . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> then , in the ADJ example given , mexico VERB production toward its comparative advantage and produced NUM pairs of shoes but only NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , if mexico can VERB no more than NUM pairs of shoes ( giving up NUM pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least NUM NOUN ( a gain of NUM NOUN ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mexico will be ADV better off . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , NOUN , NOUN and other products which are then VERB across the NOUN to and from the united states , the european union , and PROPN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM reasons : ( 1 ) the division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a second broad reason that ADJ - industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the concept of economies of scale , as introduced in cost and industry structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for ADJ reasons , and protecting against NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain ADJ economic , social , and cultural interests . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall from international trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they make imports more expensive for consumers , VERB imports . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( we VERB cover the PROPN in more detail later in the chapter . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> this agreement has since been VERB by the world trade organization ( PROPN ) , whose membership includes about NUM nations and most of the economies of the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is the primary international mechanism through which nations VERB their trade rules — including rules about tariffs , NOUN , and ADJ barriers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are a number of reasons , but NUM of them will VERB you : the trade policies of the high - income countries . <sent_end> <sent_begin> following is a ADJ review of social NOUN which has been widely VERB by the international aid organization , PROPN international . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so the domestic and foreign policy NOUN are VERB in terms of what we view as national NOUN — whether they consist of nation building abroad or NOUN building here at home , for example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ choice is often described as the “ NOUN versus NOUN ” debate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the united states VERB it useful to enter into international agreements with other countries for a variety of reasons and on a variety of different subjects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these agreements run the NOUN from ADJ agreements about tariffs to ADJ agreements among NOUN of countries about the treatment of NOUN of war . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , PROPN : university of PROPN press . <sent_end> <sent_begin> executive agreements are VERB by the president , and in the case of ADJ executive agreements , they are simultaneously approved by the president as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the north american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) , are VERB by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the house and senate ( rather than a NUM - NOUN vote in the senate as is the case for a treaty ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the key case of united states v. PROPN ( NUM ) , the supreme court ruled that executive agreements were legally ADJ to NOUN provided they did not alter federal law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> united states v. PROPN , NUM u.s. NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not VERB NOUN , while some , like the PROPN nuclear agreement , generate considerable debate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> should new international agreements into which the united states enters be VERB through the article ii treaty process of the u.s. constitution , or through executive agreements ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> this question VERB again in NUM as the PROPN nuclear agreement was being completed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that NOUN required PROPN to VERB further nuclear development and agree to nuclear NOUN , while the united states and NUM other NOUN VERB long - standing economic sanctions on PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the date indicates , it was taken on the last day of the PROPN PROPN crisis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> following the crisis , president kennedy ( far right ) met with the NOUN NOUN who VERB the ADJ NOUN ( b ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit a : modification of work by the national PROPN and record administration ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while there has sometimes been NOUN , congress has never VERB to reverse presidential action . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as discussed above , the war powers resolution VERB that the first step in the use of force was the president ’s , for the first NUM days . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a recent example of the military use of force was the u.s. role in VERB a no - NOUN zone over PROPN in NUM , which included kinetic NOUN — or active NOUN of the NOUN — to protect anti - government forces on the ground . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this ADJ domestic and international role has been described by the NUM NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this theory VERB with university of california – PROPN NOUN PROPN PROPN and suggests that there are NUM distinct NOUN , NUM for foreign policy and NUM for domestic policy , and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let ’s look at the reasoning behind this NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while the president still has stronger foreign policy powers than domestic powers , the VERB context has changed in NUM key ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , the cold war ended in NUM with the NOUN of the PROPN wall , the subsequent NOUN of the soviet union , and the ADJ opening up of ADJ european NOUN to independence and democracy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these dramatic changes removed the competitive NOUN aspect of the cold war , in which the united states and the PROPN were VERB NOUN on the world stage . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the white house NOUN members VERB in foreign policy are likely to have very ADJ contact with the president about their work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the national security NOUN VERB the president ’s national security council , a group of senior - level NOUN from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy NOUN . also VERB to the president in the white house is the director of the central intelligence agency ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in march NUM , then - secretary of defense robert PROPN ( left ) held NOUN with ADJ president PROPN PROPN in PROPN , PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit : PROPN PROPN ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the end of the cold war VERB up old NOUN as a variety of smaller european countries sought independence and old ADJ NOUN VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some in the united states felt the country should again be ADJ as the world VERB into a new political arrangement , including a ADJ senator , PROPN PROPN ( r - PROPN ) , who was against the united states VERB to be the military “ NOUN ” of the world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the other end of the spectrum is liberal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> liberal NOUN VERB a foreign policy approach in which the united states becomes ADV VERB in world affairs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM particular events in foreign policy caused many to change their views about the proper approach to u.s. involvement in world affairs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , the NOUN of u.s. involvement in the civil war in vietnam in the years leading up to NUM caused many to VERB the country ’s traditional NOUN approach to the cold war . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN was the u.s. foreign policy goal of limiting the spread of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> foreign markets VERB , NOUN helps VERB economic development at home and abroad , and global environmental challenges require cross - national NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NUM - first century , ADJ - NOUN means VERB the united states from the united nations and other international organizations that get in the way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the strategy of ADJ NOUN — VERB a strong military presence and remaining VERB across the world through NOUN and formal NOUN — is used to protect the national security interests of the united states . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the NOUN of hobby lobby stores , for example , a conservative christian , argued that his company ’s health - care plan should not have to pay for NOUN because his religious beliefs are opposed to the practice . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , in the case of PROPN v. hobby lobby stores , PROPN , the supreme court ruled in his favor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. hobby lobby stores , PROPN , NUM u.s. _ ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as discussed earlier , many conservative PROPN have also argued that they should not have to recognize same - sex NOUN because they consider NOUN to be a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to help make sure information goes from short - term memory to long - term memory , you can use memory - VERB strategies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM strategy is NOUN , or the conscious NOUN of information to be VERB ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> think about how you learned your NOUN NOUN as a child . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are memory PROPN that help us organize information for NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are especially useful when we want to recall larger NOUN of information such as steps , stages , phases , and parts of a system ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain , the senses , motor skills , and health and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this approach VERB , “ what is normal development ? ” in the early decades of the ADJ century , ADJ psychologists studied large numbers of children at various NOUN to determine norms ( i.e. , average NOUN ) of when most children reach specific developmental NOUN in each of the NUM NOUN ( PROPN , NUM , NUM , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although children develop at slightly different rates , we can use these age - related NOUN as general NOUN to compare children with same - age NOUN to determine the ADJ NOUN they should reach specific ADJ events called developmental NOUN ( e.g. , VERB , VERB , writing , NOUN , VERB NOUN , speaking in NOUN , and starting NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN suggest the NOUN of some personality traits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the NOUN of difference among people that is VERB to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a NUM NOUN ratio include leadership , NOUN to authority , a sense of well - being , NOUN , resistance to stress , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> freud viewed development as ADJ ; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood , and that if we lack proper NOUN and NOUN during a stage , we may become ADJ , or VERB , in that stage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> freud ’s stages are called the stages of ADJ development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to freud , children ’s NOUN - seeking NOUN are focused on a different area of the body , called an ADJ zone , at each of the NUM stages of development : ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , NOUN , and ADJ . while most of freud ’s ideas have not found support in modern research , we can not VERB the contributions that freud has made to the field of psychology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , they VERB new information or experiences in terms of their current NOUN : NOUN is when they take in information that is ADJ to what they already know . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN describes when they change their NOUN based on new information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process continues as children interact with their environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s second stage is the ADJ stage , which is from approximately NUM to NUM years old . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this stage , children can use NOUN to represent words , images , and ideas , which is why children in this stage engage in NOUN play . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s third stage is the ADJ ADJ stage , which occurs from about NUM to NUM years old . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this stage , children can think ADV about real ( ADJ ) events ; they have a firm NOUN on the use of numbers and start to VERB memory strategies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a major task beginning in childhood and VERB into NOUN is VERB right from NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> psychologist PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) extended upon the foundation that PROPN built regarding cognitive development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN believed that moral development , like cognitive development , follows a series of stages . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the field of social psychology studies topics at both the ADJ and ADJ levels . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN topics ( those that VERB to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social PROPN ( the ways in which we think about PRON and others ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ topics ( those that VERB to NOUN and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , NOUN and close relationships , and group processes and NOUN relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , PROPN holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an internal factor is an NOUN of a person and includes personality traits and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when you do well at a task , for example VERB an NOUN , it is in your best interest to make a ADJ NOUN for your behavior ( “ i VERB ADJ , ” ) instead of a ADJ one ( “ the NOUN was easy , ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the tendency of an individual to take credit by making ADJ or internal NOUN for positive outcomes but ADJ or external NOUN for negative outcomes is known as the self - serving bias ( miller & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this bias serves to protect self - NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during the first week after NOUN , the zygote VERB and VERB , going from a NUM - cell structure to NUM cells , then NUM cells , then NUM cells , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process of cell division is called mitosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mitosis is a ADJ process , and fewer than NUM - half of all NOUN survive beyond the first NUM weeks ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the developing NOUN is completely dependent on the mother for life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is important that the mother takes good care of PRON and receives ADJ care , which is medical care during NOUN that VERB the health of both the mother and the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the national PROPN of health ( [ PROPN ] , NUM ) , ADJ ADJ care is important because it can reduce the risk of NOUN to the mother and NOUN during NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although small , a NOUN is not completely ADJ because his NOUN and sensory NOUN help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all healthy NOUN are born with ADJ NOUN : ADJ automatic responses to particular forms of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN help the ADJ survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors — these NOUN are crucial to survival . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ motor skills focus on the muscles in our NOUN , NOUN , and eyes , and enable NOUN of small actions ( e.g. , VERB a NOUN , writing with a NOUN , and using a NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and NOUN and involve larger movements ( e.g. , VERB , running , and NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a fourth style , known as ADJ attachment , was later described ( main & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most common type of attachment — also considered the ADJ — is called secure attachment ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this type of attachment , the NOUN VERB his parent over a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for parents who VERB the ADJ style of NOUN , the NOUN run the show and PRON goes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ parents make few demands and ADV use punishment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in pre - industrial society , children were considered adults when they reached physical NOUN , but today we have an extended time between childhood and NOUN called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the period of development that begins at NOUN and ends at VERB NOUN , which is discussed later . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , NOUN is seen as a time to develop independence from parents while remaining connected to them ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the NOUN and NOUN in females and NOUN in males . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary sexual characteristics are physical NOUN of sexual NOUN that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of NOUN and NOUN in NOUN , and development of facial hair and a VERB voice in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN experience NOUN , the beginning of ADJ periods , usually around NUM years old , and NOUN experience PROPN , the first NOUN , around NUM years old . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM major social NOUN of human behavior is our social roles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a social role is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each one of us has several social roles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because of social roles , people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific , familiar NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a person ’s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how do you act on the first day of school , when you VERB into an NOUN , or are at a NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB this NOUN to hear an PROPN NOUN with PROPN PROPN where he VERB the NOUN between the PROPN prison experiment and the PROPN PROPN prison in iraq . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when we experience cognitive NOUN , we are motivated to decrease it because it is ADV , ADV , and ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can reduce cognitive NOUN by VERB our NOUN , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this can be done in different ways , such as : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the previous section we discussed that the NOUN to reduce cognitive NOUN leads us to change our attitudes , behaviors , and/or NOUN to make them ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the process of changing our NOUN toward something based on some kind of communication . <sent_end> <sent_begin> much of the NOUN we experience comes from outside forces . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM effective strategy is the NOUN - in - the - NOUN technique ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> using the NOUN - in - the - NOUN technique , the NOUN VERB a person to agree to VERB a small favor or to buy a small NOUN , only to later VERB a larger favor or purchase of a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN - in - the - NOUN technique was demonstrated in a study by PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their NOUN or sign a NOUN were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their NOUN than people who VERB the first NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) found that NUM % of participants VERB to group pressure at least once by VERB the ADJ line . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the change in a person ’s behavior to go along with the group , even if he does not agree with the group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why would people give the ADJ answer ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN was a social psychology NOUN at PROPN who was influenced by the trial of PROPN PROPN , a PROPN war criminal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s defense for the NOUN he committed was that he was “ just following NOUN . ” PROPN ( NUM ) wanted to test the NOUN of this defense , so he designed an experiment and initially VERB NUM men for his experiment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another phenomenon that occurs within group NOUN is group polarization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group polarization ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) is the NOUN of an original group NOUN after the discussion of views within a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , if a group initially VERB a NOUN , after discussion the group NOUN is likely a stronger NOUN of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it VERB their lives and their family ’s lives in positive and negative physical and psychological ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> industrial and organizational ( i - NOUN ) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a result of its interest in worker NOUN and relationships , organizational psychology also VERB the subjects of NOUN , including sexual NOUN , and workplace violence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and how to design those tools to VERB workers ’ productivity , safety , and health . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these studies can involve interactions as ADJ as the fit of a NOUN , NOUN , and computer to a human having to VERB on the NOUN at the NOUN using the computer for several hours each day . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> analysis of the NOUN by later researchers led to the term the PROPN effect , which describes the increase in performance of individuals who are VERB , VERB , and paid attention to by researchers or NOUN [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what the original researchers found was that any change in a variable , such as NOUN levels , led to an NOUN in productivity ; this was true even when the change was negative , such as a return to poor NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today , i - NOUN psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice , as you will learn about in the rest of this chapter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the society for industrial and organizational psychology ( PROPN ) , a division of the apa , VERB NUM members ( PROPN , NUM ) and the bureau of labor statistics — PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> department of labor ( NUM ) has VERB this NOUN will have the greatest growth of all job NOUN in the NUM years following NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on average , a person with a NOUN ’s degree in industrial - organizational psychology will earn over $ NUM a year , while someone with a NOUN will earn over $ NUM a year ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sometimes people will act on their ADJ attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination . <sent_end> <sent_begin> discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one ’s membership in a particular group ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice ADV , such as VERB older adults from their NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> prejudice and discrimination VERB in society due to social learning and NOUN to social norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> children learn ADJ attitudes and beliefs from society : their parents , NOUN , NOUN , the media , and other sources of socialization , such as PROPN ( PROPN & PROPN - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when VERB with the target of our prejudice , we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our ADJ expectations and VERB information that is ADJ with our expectations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this process , known as NOUN bias , we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and VERB information that is ADJ with our stereotypes ( PROPN & johnson - PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the job NOUN example , the NOUN may not have VERB that the job NOUN was ADJ and engaging , and that he provided ADJ responses to the NOUN questions in the beginning of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because we often feel a strong sense of VERB and emotional connection to our in - groups , we develop in - group bias : a NOUN for our own group over other groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this in - group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out - group is perceived as different and is less ADJ than our in - group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> aggression takes NUM forms depending on one ’s NOUN : hostile or instrumental . <sent_end> <sent_begin> hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with NOUN to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a NOUN is an example of hostile aggression . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by VERB a goal and does not necessarily involve ADJ to cause pain ( PROPN , NUM ) ; a contract NOUN who VERB for hire NOUN instrumental aggression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is repeated negative treatment of another person , often an NOUN , over time ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NUM - time NOUN in which NUM child VERB another child on the NOUN would not be considered NOUN : NOUN is repeated behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is a common NOUN , as the following well - VERB event VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , in PROPN , new york , a ADJ - old woman named PROPN PROPN was VERB by a person with a NOUN near the back NOUN to her NOUN building and again in the NOUN inside her NOUN building . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when the attack occurred , she VERB for help numerous times and eventually VERB from her NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when you and another person share similar music taste , NOUN , food NOUN , and so on , VERB what to do with your time together might be easy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the tendency for people to form social NOUN , including NOUN , marriage , business relationships , and many other types of relationships , with others who are similar ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> robert PROPN ( NUM ) proposed that there are NUM components of love : NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NUM components form a NOUN that VERB multiple types of love : this is known as PROPN ’s ADJ theory of love ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN of NOUN and ADJ thoughts and emotions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ love , which is characteristic of close NOUN and family relationships , consists of NOUN and NOUN but no NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ love is defined by having NOUN and NOUN , but no NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , ADJ love is defined by having NOUN and NOUN , but no NOUN , such as a long term sexual love NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this allows the i - NOUN psychologist to access previous NOUN for nearly any type of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this system is called PROPN ( ADJ at NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the site is open and you can see the NOUN that are listed for your own position or one you might be ADJ about . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance , a decision based on group membership is ADJ ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to combat VERB discrimination , in the united states there are numerous city , state , and federal laws that prevent VERB based on various group - membership NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , did you know it is illegal for a potential NOUN to VERB your age in an NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the civil rights act and the age discrimination in employment act make provisions for X ADJ ADJ NOUN ( NOUN ) , which are requirements of certain NOUN for which VERB an individual employment would otherwise VERB the law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , there may be cases in which religion , national origin , age , and sex are ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> job stress affects job satisfaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> job stress , or job NOUN , is caused by specific NOUN in an NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around which the employee may schedule his NOUN and NOUN from work to meet family demands . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves employees working at home and setting their own hours , which allows them to work during different parts of the day , and to spend part of the day with their family . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that PROPN PUNCT <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the theory y approach , on the other hand , NOUN VERB that most people seek inner satisfaction and NOUN from their work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in , and provide input about , setting their personal and work goals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> organizations need to respond quickly to changes in these factors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many companies are VERB to these changes by VERB their organizations so that work can be VERB to work NOUN , which bring together diverse skills , experience , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM well - recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of NOUN , including sexual NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most organizations of any size have developed sexual NOUN policies that define sexual NOUN ( or NOUN in general ) and the NOUN the organization has set in place to prevent and address it when it does occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is a NOUN of the importance of ADJ justice in organizations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ justice refers to the NOUN of the processes by which outcomes are determined in NOUN with or among employees . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term stress as it VERB to the human condition first emerged in scientific NOUN in the 1930s , but it did not enter the popular NOUN until the 1970s ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today , we often use the term ADV in describing a variety of ADJ NOUN states ; for example , we often say we are VERB out when we feel ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , or ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a useful way to VERB stress is to view it as a process ADV an individual VERB and VERB to events that he VERB as ADJ or VERB to his well - being ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a critical element of this definition is that it VERB the importance of how we VERB — that is , judge — VERB or ADJ events ( often referred to as NOUN ) ; these NOUN , in turn , influence our reactions to such events . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM kinds of NOUN of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , VERB force that can improve the quality of our lives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this kind of stress , which PROPN called NOUN ( from the greek PROPN = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , ADJ health , and performance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as previously stated , scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the early NOUN in the study of stress was PROPN PROPN , an ADJ american NOUN at PROPN medical school ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the early part of the ADJ century , PROPN was the first to identify the body ’s physiological reactions to stress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these physiological reactions were ADJ , which means that regardless of the type of stressor , the same pattern of reactions would occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what PROPN discovered was the general NOUN syndrome , the body ’s ADJ physiological response to stress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of NOUN VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at this stage , the person is no longer able to VERB to the stressor : the body ’s ability to VERB becomes VERB as physical NOUN takes its NOUN on the body ’s tissues and organs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in short NOUN , this process can have some ADJ effects , such as providing extra energy , VERB immune system functioning ADV , and VERB pain NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , extended release of NOUN — as would happen with ADJ or ADJ stress — often comes at a high price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for an individual to experience stress , he must first VERB a potential stressor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in general , NOUN can be placed into NUM of NUM broad categories : ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN and PROPN social PROPN PROPN scale ( PROPN ) uses the ADJ research method to identify the connection between stress and health . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , NOUN ’ PROPN NOUN are VERB with the number or frequency of self - reported symptoms VERB health problems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some people who are exposed to ADV stressful work conditions can experience job NOUN , which is a general sense of emotional NOUN and NOUN in NOUN to one ’s job ( PROPN & jackson , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> job NOUN occurs frequently among those in human service jobs ( e.g. , social workers , NOUN , NOUN , and police officers ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in cases of NOUN , the best treatment is thought to address both ( or multiple ) disorders simultaneously ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> behavior NOUN are used to treat NOUN conditions , and in many cases , ADJ NOUN are used along with NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a sense , the immune system is the body ’s NOUN system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it consists of a variety of structures , cells , and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from VERB NOUN and microorganisms that can VERB or damage the body ’s tissues and organs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during ADJ - pituitary - adrenal ( PROPN ) axis NOUN can ADV impact immune function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM way they do this is by VERB the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that VERB in the body ’s fluids that are important in the immune response ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a major risk factor for heart disease is NOUN , which is high blood pressure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN forces a person ’s heart to VERB ADV , thus VERB more physical NOUN on the heart . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in addition to anger and NOUN , a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease , including negative NOUN and depression ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> negative NOUN is a tendency to experience VERB emotional states involving anger , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , fear , and NOUN ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it has been linked with the development of both NOUN and heart disease . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once a person VERB treatment , whether ADV or ADV , he has an NOUN done to VERB his ADJ needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is the therapist ’s first meeting with the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in group therapy , a NOUN VERB together with several clients with similar problems ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when children are placed in group therapy , it is particularly important to VERB clients for age and problems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are several different types of family therapy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in structural family therapy , the therapist VERB and VERB the NOUN and structure of the family : who makes the rules , who VERB in the NOUN with whom , how decisions are made , and what are the NOUN within the family . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some families , the parents do not work together to make rules , or NUM parent may VERB the other , leading the children to act out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in modern practice , it has evolved NOUN what is known as ADJ therapy , which will be discussed later . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ therapy involves NOUN and/or medical NOUN to treat psychological disorders . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , we will explore the various ADJ NOUN VERB in [ link ] ( many of these NOUN were discussed in the PROPN chapter ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , a patient would demonstrate resistance to VERB these thoughts or situations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN analysis , a therapist VERB the underlying meaning of dreams . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to VERB on a NOUN and recall their dreams or engage in traditional NOUN therapy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this technique uses a ADJ process of play to “ help clients prevent or VERB ADJ NOUN and achieve ADJ growth ” ( PROPN , NUM , NOUN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM commonly used classical conditioning ADJ technique is NOUN : a NOUN VERB a new response to a stimulus that has previously VERB an ADJ behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM NOUN techniques are ADJ conditioning and exposure therapy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM years later , PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) VERB PROPN ’s techniques , giving us the behavior therapy technique of exposure therapy that is used today . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a popular form of exposure therapy is systematic NOUN , ADV a ADJ and ADJ state is gradually associated with increasing levels of anxiety - VERB stimuli . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea is that you VERB n’t be nervous and ADJ at the same time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cognitive therapy is a form of NOUN that focuses on how a person ’s thoughts lead to feelings of distress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think VERB how you feel and act . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational ADJ therapy ( PROPN ) , which was founded by PROPN PROPN and grew out of his NOUN of ADJ NOUN ( daniel , PROPN . ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN such as PROPN PROPN also influenced PROPN ’s ADJ approach ( national association of cognitive - behavioral PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cognitive - behavioral therapy ( PROPN ) helps clients VERB how their thoughts affect their behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB to change cognitive NOUN and self - VERB behaviors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rogers ( NUM ) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking help was ADJ and looking for a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since this is a form of PROPN therapy , a ADJ approach in which the therapist does not give NOUN or provide NOUN but helps the person to identify NOUN and understand feelings , rogers ( NUM ) VERB the importance of the person taking control of his own life to VERB life ’s challenges . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another ADV based treatment that continues to be used , although ADV , is NOUN therapy ( PROPN ) ( ADV known by its ADJ name as NOUN therapy ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it involves using an electrical current to VERB NOUN to help VERB the effects of severe depression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as an example , VERB PROPN receives a NOUN NOUN that he is VERB statistics class . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if PROPN VERB a problem - focused VERB approach to VERB his stress , he would be ADJ in trying to VERB the source of the stress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he might contact his NOUN to discuss what must be done to raise his NOUN , he might also decide to set ADV NUM hours daily to study statistics NOUN , and he may seek NOUN assistance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN believed that the dogs who VERB to try to escape the later NOUN were VERB learned NOUN : they had acquired a belief that they were ADJ to do PRON about the ADJ NOUN they were receiving . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN also believed that the NOUN and lack of NOUN these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> their review is VERB at determining which VERB strategies are most effective at VERB negative health outcomes associated with racism - related stress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the NOUN of NUM VERB strategies : focusing on racial identity to VERB race - related stress , anger expression / NOUN , and seeking social support . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you VERB learned a NOUN about social support , so we VERB focus the NOUN of this discussion on the potential VERB strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / NOUN . focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he VERB to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of NOUN associated with group membership . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1970s , PROPN PROPN , a NOUN , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the relaxation response technique VERB relaxation with ADJ NOUN , and consists of NUM components ( PROPN , NUM ) : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for practical purposes , a ADJ definition of happiness might VERB each of these elements : an VERB state of mind consisting of NOUN , NOUN , and other positive emotions , plus the sense that one ’s life has meaning and value ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the definition implies that happiness is a long - term state — what is often characterized as ADJ well - being — rather than ADV a ADJ positive mood we all experience from time to time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADV setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , PROPN helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a very general sense , positive psychology can be thought of as the science of happiness ; it is an area of study that VERB to identify and promote those NOUN that lead to greater NOUN in our lives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this field looks at people ’s NOUN and what helps individuals to lead ADJ , ADJ lives , and it moves away from focusing on people ’s NOUN , NOUN , and problems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another factor that seems to be important in VERB a deep sense of well - being is the ability to VERB flow from the things we do in life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and ADJ that it becomes worth doing for its own NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is usually related to ADJ NOUN and NOUN activities , but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the ADJ century , PROPN PROPN led reform efforts for mental health care in the united states ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> she VERB how those who are ADV ADJ and poor were VERB for , and she discovered an ADJ and ADJ system that VERB abuse of this population ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other individuals might ADV seek treatment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> voluntary treatment means the person VERB to VERB therapy to obtain relief from symptoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he called this condition early ADJ NOUN , and it was characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional NOUN with others , speech and language NOUN , ADJ behaviors , and an NOUN of minor changes in the environment and in normal NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what the dsm-5 refers to as NOUN spectrum disorder today , is a direct extension of PROPN ’s work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ disorders are characterized by an individual becoming split off , or VERB , from her core sense of self . <sent_end> <sent_begin> memory and identity become ADJ ; these disturbances have a psychological rather than physical cause . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> goods that are ADJ and ADJ are called common resources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the NOUN of the PROPN are open to all NOUN NOUN , and because any NOUN that you VERB is NOUN that i can not VERB , common resources like the NOUN tend to be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the current u.s. poverty line is essentially the same as the PROPN poverty line , although the dollar amounts are adjusted each year to represent the same buying power over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. poverty line in NUM VERB from $ NUM for a single individual to $ NUM for a household of NUM people . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows the u.s. poverty rate over time ; that is , the percentage of the population below the poverty line in any given year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the poverty rate VERB through the 1960s , VERB in the early 1980s and early 1990s , but seems to have been slightly lower since the NOUN NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a single mother ( earning $ NUM an hour ) with NUM children , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , consider the labor - NOUN budget constraint faced by this family in a situation without government assistance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the horizontal axis is hours of NOUN ( or time spent with family responsibilities ) increasing in quantity from right to left . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the u.s. government has VERB a number of programs to VERB those below the poverty line and those who have NOUN just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor . such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB participation increased by NUM % between NUM and NUM , from NUM NUM participants to NUM NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the congressional budget office , this dramatic rise in participation was caused by the great recession of NUM – NUM and rising food prices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federal government VERB a range of income security programs that are funded through NOUN such as health and human services , PROPN , and housing and urban development ( PROPN ) ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the office of management and budget , collectively , these NUM NOUN provided an estimated $ NUM NUM of aid through programs such as ADJ NOUN programs for women and children , VERB housing , and energy assistance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists have focused their NOUN for the increasing inequality on NUM factors that changed more or less ADV from the 1970s into the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM set of NOUN focuses on the changing shape of american households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ NOUN take all ” labor markets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the NOUN for growing inequality in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> measuring income distribution by PROPN common way of measuring income inequality is to VERB all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into NUM groups with equal numbers of people , known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the programs are paid for through the federal income tax , which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> data from household income tax returns in NUM shows that the top NUM % of households had an average income of $ NUM per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the united states does have an NOUN tax — that is , a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance — which suggests a NOUN to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , according to the center on budget and policy PROPN , in NUM the NOUN tax applied only to those leaving NOUN of more than $ NUM NUM and thus VERB to only a ADJ percentage of those with high levels of wealth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB these questions , let ’s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must VERB with a single union , and no firm is allowed to hire ADJ labor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if no labor union existed in this market , then equilibrium ( e ) in the labor market would occur at the NOUN of the demand for labor ( d ) and the supply of labor ( s ) in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the past , presidential use of the PROPN - PROPN act sometimes has made labor NOUN more ADJ and ADJ but , in this case , it seems to have VERB the NOUN to an agreement . in other instances , unions have VERB quite willing to VERB new NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM prominent example , during the 1950s and 1960s , the united PROPN union demanded that NOUN companies VERB labor - saving NOUN in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN ’ union VERB that over time , the new NOUN would reduce the number of jobs in the NOUN , but the union leaders also VERB that the NOUN owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive , and NOUN was a necessary step toward greater productivity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are ADJ solely because of a factor such as race , gender , or religion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets , which VERB if workers with the same NOUN levels — as measured by education , experience , and NOUN — receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if some businesses run by ADJ employers VERB to pay women and/or NOUN a wage based on their productivity , then other profit - seeking employers can hire these workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a competitive market , if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin , they will have an incentive to make buying , selling , VERB , and NOUN decisions ADV based on economic factors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those who express concern about immigration levels to the united states point to NOUN like [ link ] which shows total NOUN of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> clearly , the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years , reaching and VERB the VERB levels of the early twentieth century . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the general rule is that all NOUN to NOUN should be VERB , but often NOUN is not made . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as such , many buyers face a situation of ADJ information , where the both parties involved in an economic NOUN have an ADJ amount of information ( NUM party VERB much more than the other ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product ’s price and quality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if there is limited information , then buyers and sellers may not be able to VERB or will ADV make poor decisions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when buyers use the market price to draw NOUN about the quality of products , then markets may have NOUN reaching an equilibrium price and quantity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> imagine a situation where a used car NOUN has a NOUN full of used cars that do not seem to be selling , and so the NOUN VERB to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the goods market , the seller of a good might offer a money - back NOUN , an agreement that functions as a promise of quality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this strategy may be especially important for a company that VERB goods through NOUN - order NOUN or over the web , whose NOUN can not see the actual products , because it VERB people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sellers of labor provide information through NOUN , NOUN , school NOUN , and examples of their work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are also used to establish quality in the labor market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , which are typically issued by government agencies , show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a ADJ borrower VERB out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank VERB a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another approach is to require a NOUN on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally VERB to VERB some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet another approach is to require NOUN , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to VERB and sell if the loan is not VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN insurance : employers that offer NOUN to their VERB employees are required by law to pay a small NOUN of what they are setting ADV for NOUN to the PROPN benefit PROPN corporation , which is used to pay at least some NOUN benefits to workers if a company goes ADJ and can not pay the NOUN it has VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN insurance : all workers pay a percentage of their income into social security and into medicare , which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social security and medicare are not literally “ insurance ” in the sense that those ADV VERB to the fund are not eligible for benefits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another method to reduce moral NOUN is to require the VERB party to pay a share of the costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , insurance policies often have NOUN , which is an amount that the insurance NOUN must pay out of their own NOUN before the insurance coverage VERB paying . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NOUN insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a final way of reducing moral NOUN , which is especially ADJ to health care , is to focus on the NOUN of NOUN of health care , rather than consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> traditionally , most health care in the united states has been provided on a NOUN - for - service basis , which means that medical care NOUN are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has VERB to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the affordable care act ( PROPN ) will be funded through additional taxes to include : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and VERB to earn profits in the future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples include when a firm VERB a machine that will last NUM years , or VERB a new plant that will last for NUM years , or VERB a research and development project . <sent_end> <sent_begin> firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in NUM main ways : ( 1 ) from early - stage investors ; ( 2 ) by VERB profits ; ( 3 ) by borrowing through banks or bonds ; and ( NUM ) by selling stock . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this way , an individual NOUN could , in effect , loan the firm $ NUM , or any multiple of that amount . <sent_end> <sent_begin> anyone who VERB a bond and receives the interest payments is called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a firm issues bonds and VERB to make the VERB interest payments , the NOUN can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling NOUN or equipment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those who buy the stock become the owners , or NOUN , of the firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who VERB NUM % of a company ’s stock , by definition , VERB the entire company . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the stock of a company is divided into NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that rate of return can come in NUM forms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a firm can make a direct payment to its NOUN , called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , a financial NOUN might buy a share of stock in PROPN - PROPN for $ NUM and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ NUM , for a gain of $ NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a ADJ NOUN , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a private company can also be a corporation , but with no ADV issued stock . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a high - risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return , including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN account typically pays little or no interest , but it VERB transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a NOUN card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately VERB from your NOUN account rather than being VERB ADV through a credit card company ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a NOUN to the bank or an automatic NOUN machine ( or you can access the funds ADV ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the lines between NOUN and savings accounts have VERB in the last NOUN of decades , as many banks offer VERB accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account , or conversely , offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few NOUN per NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> firms that appear to be ADJ NOUN , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear ADJ , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bonds that offer high interest rates to VERB for their relatively high chance of NOUN are called high NOUN bonds or NOUN bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a number of today ’s well - known firms issued NOUN bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow , including PROPN PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( bonds used to be paper documents with NOUN that were VERB and turned in to the bank to receive interest . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bond has a NOUN date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and NOUN date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to VERB a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows bond NOUN for NUM kinds of bonds : NUM year treasury bonds ( which are ADV called “ NOUN ” ) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an NOUN NOUN as relatively safe NOUN by PROPN ’s , an independent firm that VERB such NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate , because firms are ADJ NOUN than the federal government , the rates tend to rise and fall together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> purchasing a ADJ group of the NOUN or bonds has VERB ADJ in the internet age , but it remains something of a task . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to VERB the process , companies offer ADJ funds , which are organizations that buy a range of NOUN or bonds from different companies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the financial NOUN VERB NOUN of the ADJ fund , and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the chief problem with VERB to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , in VERB to get rich in the stock market , it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same NOUN , because the stock price will already be high , based on the expected high level of future profits . the idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , many u.s. NOUN do not much care where the NOUN for their car were made — they just want good quality as ADV as they can get it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in september NUM , president obama and congress VERB a NOUN ( taxes added on imported goods ) on NOUN imported from china that would increase the NOUN price of chinese NOUN by NUM percent in its first year , NUM percent in its second year , and NUM percent in its third year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , the u.s. companies that make NOUN did not favor this step , because most of them also VERB NOUN from china and other countries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in environmental protection and negative externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in monopoly and antitrust policy ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or NOUN on how to VERB environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has NOUN who study every word and every NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they VERB with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district , where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , when legislators are VERB over whether to support a piece of legislation , they commonly VERB each other to include NOUN - NOUN spending , legislation that benefits mainly a single political district . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - NOUN spending is another case in which democracy is VERB by concentrated benefits and widely VERB costs : the benefits of NOUN - NOUN spending are obvious and direct to local voters , while the costs are spread over the entire country . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> does the majority view VERB in the case of sugar NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> clearly there are more sugar consumers in the united states than sugar producers , but the u.s. domestic sugar lobby ( NOUN ) has successfully argued for protection against imports since NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a firm produces a product no one VERB to buy or produces at a higher cost than its NOUN , the firm is likely to VERB losses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if it can not change its ways , it will go out of business . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as you learn in the ADJ part of this book , ADJ tools used by economists are theories and models ( see INTJ to economics PUNCT <sent_end> <sent_begin> for more on this ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , we used the theories of supply and demand ; in NOUN , we use the theories of aggregate demand ( ad ) and aggregate supply ( as ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this book VERB NUM NOUN on NOUN : the neoclassical perspective and the keynesian perspective , each of which has its own version of ad and as . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment , primarily by businesses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if PROPN VERB a new store , or PROPN VERB NOUN , these expenditures are counted under business investment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> everything that is VERB must be produced first . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] VERB down what is produced into NUM categories : ADJ goods , ADJ goods , services , structures , and the change in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before going into detail about these categories , VERB that total gdp measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the gdp measured by looking at the NUM components of demand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> net national product ( PROPN ) is calculated by taking PROPN and then VERB the value of how much physical capital is VERB out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process by which capital NOUN and VERB value is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN can be further VERB into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nominal value of any economic NOUN means the NOUN is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the real value refers to the same NOUN after it has been adjusted for inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> generally , it is the real value that is more important . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because NUM is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , over time , the rise in nominal gdp looks much larger than the rise in real gdp ( that is , the nominal gdp line rises more ADV than the real gdp line ) , because the rise in nominal gdp is VERB by the presence of inflation , especially in the 1970s . PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nominal and real gdp , NUM – NUM <sent_end> <sent_begin> the red line measures u.s. gdp in nominal dollars . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an especially ADJ and deep recession is called a depression . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the severe NOUN in gdp that occurred during the great depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the great recession of NUM – NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a private think NOUN , the national bureau of economic research ( PROPN ) , is the official NOUN of business cycles for the u.s. economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the effects of a severe recession often VERB on after the official VERB date VERB by the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> key concepts and PROPN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so is the u.s. economy larger than other countries just because the united states has more people than most other countries , or because the u.s. economy is actually larger on a per - person basis ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> this question can be VERB by VERB a country ’s gdp per capita ; that is , the gdp divided by the population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gdp has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gdp per capita is only an average . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when gdp per capita rises by NUM % , it could mean that gdp for everyone in the society has VERB by NUM % , or that of some groups has VERB by more while that of others has VERB by less — or even VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to the ADJ economic NOUN PROPN PROPN van PROPN , slavery - based societies , ADJ NOUN , global trading NOUN , and ADJ trading institutions that spread with different NOUN set the stage for the industrial revolution to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the industrial revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven NOUN and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN — the NOUN NOUN , the power NOUN , and the NOUN NOUN — performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other words , how efficient is your nation with its time and workers ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ way to VERB labor productivity is to imagine a ADJ worker who can make NUM NOUN of NOUN in an hour versus a u.s. worker who in the same hour can make only NUM NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB the sources of economic growth , it is useful to think about a production function , which is the process of VERB economic inputs like labor , NOUN , and ADJ materials into NOUN like goods and services used by consumers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ production function describes the inputs and NOUN of a firm , or perhaps an industry . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it causes the total amount of financial savings to grow ADV over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , compound rates of economic growth , or the compound growth rate , means that the rate of growth is being VERB by a base that includes past gdp growth , with dramatic effects over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it may not make sense to compare the NOUN of china and say , PROPN , simply because of the great difference in population size . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on gdp per capita . <sent_end> <sent_begin> using gdp per capita also makes it ADJ to compare countries with smaller numbers of people , like PROPN , PROPN , or PROPN , with countries that have larger populations , like the united states , the PROPN PROPN , or PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> special economic zones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the island of PROPN is NUM of the few african nations to encourage international trade in government - supported special economic zones ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are areas of the country , usually with access to a NOUN where , among other benefits , the government does not tax trade . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a first argument is based on VERB marginal returns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even though VERB human and physical capital will tend to increase gdp per capita , the law of VERB returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital , the marginal gains to economic growth will VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , raising the average education level of the population by NUM years from a ADJ - NOUN level to a high school NOUN ( while holding all other inputs constant ) would produce a certain increase in output . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but ADJ factory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the ADJ workers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are , however , also counted in the employed group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all of these individuals fall under the NOUN of the term “ VERB unemployment . ” ADJ workers , those who have VERB looking for employment and , hence , are no longer counted in the NOUN also fall into this group <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of rises and falls in unemployment NOUN fairly well with the NOUN of NOUN and NOUN in the overall economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during periods of recession and depression , unemployment is high . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during periods of economic growth , unemployment tends to be lower . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion ( X . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the business cycle ) is known as ADJ unemployment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM set of reasons why wages may be “ ADJ downward , ” as economists put it , involves economic laws and institutions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for low - skilled workers being paid the minimum wage , it is illegal to reduce their wages . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for union workers operating under a ADJ contract with a company , wage cuts might VERB the contract and create a labor NOUN or a strike . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> efficiency wage theory VERB that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it ADJ to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would VERB a decline in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN - NOUN model of the labor force , in simple terms , VERB that those already working for firms are “ NOUN , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> a firm depends on its NOUN to VERB the NOUN of the organization , to be familiar with ADJ NOUN , to VERB new employees , and so on . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , VERB wages will VERB the NOUN and damage the firm ’s productivity and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , the relative wage NOUN argument points out that even if most workers were ADV willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a ADJ economy to VERB such a plan . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , workers VERB with the possibility of a wage cut will VERB that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being ADJ off both in absolute terms and relative to others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but in the real world , even if the number of job NOUN is equal to the number of job NOUN , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to VERB and figure out if the new job is a good NOUN , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in NOUN to a new job . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the unemployment that occurs in the NOUN , as workers move between jobs , is called ADJ unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ unemployment is not ADV a bad NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> inflation is a general and ADJ rise in the level of prices in an entire economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a NOUN of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> price NOUN are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to convert the money spent on the NOUN to an index number , economists ADV choose NUM year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the base year , by definition , has an index number equal to NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a fixed and ADJ NOUN of goods VERB that consumers are VERB into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , NOUN bias — the rise in the price of a fixed NOUN of goods over time — tends to VERB the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can VERB away from goods whose relative prices have VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN also VERB several price NOUN that are not based on NOUN of consumer goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the producer price index ( PROPN ) is based on prices paid for NOUN and inputs by producers of goods and services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it can be broken down into price NOUN for different industries , NOUN , and stages of processing ( like VERB goods , intermediate goods , ADJ materials for further processing , and so on ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gdp NOUN , measured by the bureau of economic analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of gdp ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike the PROPN , its NOUN are not fixed but re - calculate what that year ’s gdp would have been worth using the base - year ’s prices . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> inflation in china VERB about NUM % per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , although it has VERB off since then . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN experienced NOUN — an NOUN of high inflation — of NUM % per year in the early 1990s , although by NUM PROPN ’s consumer price inflation had VERB below NUM % per year , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ the united states has ever VERB to NOUN was during the civil war , NUM – NUM , in the confederate states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> countries with relatively high inflation rates , NUM – NUM <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year ’s consumer prices in brazil , china , and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted ADV and immediately with inflation , as in the land of PROPN money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates NOUN for workers and may involve ADJ , ADJ NOUN between employers and employees . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only ADV , minimum wage workers are VERB purchasing power from their nominal wages , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> u.s. minimum wage and inflation after VERB for inflation , the federal minimum wage VERB more than NUM percent from NUM to NUM , even though the nominal figure VERB from $ NUM to $ NUM per hour . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> prices are the NOUN in a market economy , VERB information about conditions of demand and supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> inflation VERB those price NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second , an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the discussion in unemployment VERB out that wages tend to be ADJ in their downward movements and that unemployment can result . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1970s and 1980s , labor unions commonly VERB wage NOUN that had cost - of - living NOUN ( NOUN ) which VERB that their wages would keep up with inflation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN were sometimes written as , for example , PROPN plus NUM % . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> also , social security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount — $ NUM in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation , so that the VERB rise in the benefit level is VERB by an VERB increase in the social security tax base . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as yet another example of a government program affected by NOUN , in NUM the u.s. , government began VERB ADJ bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bonds are means by which the u.s. government ( and many private - NOUN companies as well ) VERB money ; that is , investors buy the bonds , and then the government VERB the money with interest . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports VERB imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if imports VERB exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if exports and imports are equal , then trade is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> old NOUN are hard to break . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists , however , typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second NOUN of [ link ] provides data on trade in services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here , the u.s. economy is running a surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some of the other countries listed include brazil , the largest economy in latin america ; PROPN , the largest economy in africa ; and china , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first NOUN offers NUM measure of the globalization of an economy : exports of goods and services as a percentage of gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second NOUN shows the trade balance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the connection between trade NOUN and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each category of the current account balance involves a ADJ flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the NOUN of the trade and current account balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for most years of the nineteenth century , u.s. imports VERB exports and the u.s. economy had a trade deficit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet the NOUN of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all ; instead , the trade deficits VERB to the strong economic growth that gave the u.s. economy the highest per capita gdp in the world by around NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the united states has a low level of trade , but had ADJ trade deficits for most years from the NOUN 1980s into the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those economists who VERB the role of supply in the NOUN often refer to the work of a famous french economist of the early nineteenth century named PROPN - PROPN say ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> say ’s law is : “ supply creates its own demand . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a matter of ADJ NOUN , it seems clear that say never actually wrote down this law and that it VERB his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful NOUN for VERB a point of view . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN behind say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it VERB income that is earned for someone : a worker , a NOUN , an NOUN , or those who are workers , NOUN , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms VERB losses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , a recession is not a situation where all business NOUN are exactly VERB by an VERB number of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is VERB in size , business NOUN VERB the remaining success NOUN , and many firms end up VERB losses and VERB off workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> say ’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good NOUN for the long run . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many newspapers now maintain both a NOUN and an internet presence in order to VERB for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rise of free news NOUN , such as the PROPN post , have made it difficult for newspapers to force NOUN to purchase ADJ NOUN to access material they place behind a ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some local newspapers , in an effort to VERB visible and ADJ , have turned to social media , like PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people wanted to know what was VERB , and they wanted to know immediately . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although initially ADJ to be on the air , NOUN PROPN PROPN PROPN of PROPN began VERB live about germany ’s actions from his NOUN in europe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> his NOUN VERB news and some NOUN , and even live coverage during germany ’s ADJ NOUN of PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first television NOUN , run by presidential candidates PROPN d. PROPN and PROPN PROPN in the early 1950s , were mainly radio NOUN with NOUN or short question - and - answer NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , john f. kennedy ’s campaign used a PROPN - style approach to promote his image as young and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the kennedy campaign ran interesting and engaging NOUN , VERB kennedy , his NOUN PROPN , and everyday citizens who supported him . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> following the ADJ attacks in new york and washington on september NUM , NUM , president george w. bush ’s NOUN speech from the NOUN of ground zero in new york similarly became a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> bush VERB to the workers and first NOUN and encouraged them , but his short speech became a viral NOUN VERB the NOUN of new PROPN and the anger of a nation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN , “ bush VERB ground NUM in lower PROPN , ” PROPN , NUM september NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he VERB new PROPN , the country , and the world that americans could hear the NOUN and NOUN of new york , and that the NOUN would soon hear the united states ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , especially members of generation x and PROPN , like their NOUN to be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the daily show and the PROPN report demonstrate that news , even political news , can win young NOUN if delivered well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , PROPN , “ PROPN PROPN just VERB a $ NUM NUM PROPN in PROPN ’s value , ” PROPN , NUM february NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such soft news VERB news in an ADJ and ADJ manner , ADV VERB a variety of topics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the depth or quality of NOUN may be less than ideal , these shows can sound an NOUN as needed to raise citizen awareness ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> john PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the approval of the first amendment , as a part of the bill of rights , demonstrated the NOUN ’ belief that a free and ADJ press was important enough to protect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it said : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a public figure must show that the NOUN or NOUN VERB in “ ADJ NOUN ” when VERB information as NOUN or that the NOUN ’s NOUN was ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this test goes back to the new york times v. PROPN ( NUM ) case , in which a police NOUN in PROPN VERB over ADJ statements in a NOUN NOUN . new york times PROPN v. PROPN , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> in NUM , the supreme court heard the PROPN papers case , in which the u.s. government VERB the new york times and the washington post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the vietnam war . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the supreme court ruled that while the government can impose prior NOUN on the media , meaning the government can prevent the NOUN of information , that right is very limited . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the court gave the newspapers the right to VERB much of the study , but NOUN of NOUN movements and the names of ADJ NOUN are some of the few approved reasons for which the government can stop NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN act of NUM replaced the radio act and created a more powerful NOUN to VERB the NOUN — a NUM - member federal PROPN commission ( PROPN ) to VERB both radio and NOUN communication . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN , which now has only NUM members ( [ link ] ) , requires radio stations to apply for NOUN , granted only if stations follow rules about limiting NOUN , providing a public NOUN for discussion , and serving local and minority communities . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN also VERB NOUN regulations over television , radio , and other NOUN , which limit ADJ material and keep the public NOUN free of ADJ material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ obscenity , PROPN , and NOUN , ” PROPN , PROPN ( september NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while the supreme court has VERB to define obscenity , it is identified using a test VERB in miller v. california ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> miller v. california , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> the press has had some assistance in VERB its NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> laws that VERB federal and many state government NOUN and meeting documents be made available to the public are called NOUN laws . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN believe that open NOUN allow democracy to VERB and NOUN allows NOUN to occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to cover war up close , more journalists are VERB to travel with troops during ADJ conflict . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , george w. bush ’s administration decided to allow more journalists in the field , VERB the NOUN would reduce friction between the military and the press . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the u.s. department of defense placed NUM - NUM journalists in a media NOUN camp to VERB them to be embedded with military NOUN in iraq . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> journalists who VERB a source and ADV protect him or her from being ADV tried for a crime may spend time in NOUN for NOUN of court . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the case of PROPN v.

<sent_begin> NOUN can also affect the way we see race , NOUN , or other NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for this reason , it is linked to NOUN : when media coverage VERB the NOUN or NOUN to a particular perspective on a subject or issue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if a NOUN article focuses on unemployment , VERB industries , and jobs moving ADV , the NOUN will have a negative opinion about the economy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB through the NOUN : presidential leadership , public opinion , and the news media . PROPN , PROPN : PROPN university press . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when obama first VERB office in NUM , journalists focused on his NOUN with congress , VERB his leadership style and inability to work with representative PROPN PROPN , then speaker of the house . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to gain attention for his policies , specifically the american recovery and PROPN act ( PROPN ) , obama began VERB the united states to draw the media away from congress and encourage discussion of his economic stimulus NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once the PROPN had been passed , obama began VERB again , speaking ADV about why the country needed the affordable care act and VERB media coverage to promote support for the act . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> why do we have NUM parties ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM - party system came into being because the structure of u.s. elections , with NUM NOUN VERB to a geographic district , tends to lead to NOUN by NUM major political parties . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even when there are other NOUN on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of VERB even a single office . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes VERB , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( NUM percent or greater ) of the total votes VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , abraham lincoln won the presidency in NUM even though he clearly VERB majority support given the number of candidates in the race . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , NUM candidates VERB for the presidency : lincoln , a republican ; NUM democrats , NUM from the northern wing of the party and NUM from the southern wing ; and a member of the newly formed constitutional union party , a southern party that VERB to prevent the nation from VERB over the issue of slavery . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB NOUN voting , even if the NOUN - take - all election were VERB , would almost ADV increase the number of parties from which voters could choose . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN would be to a ADJ voting NOUN , in which a candidate VERB only if he or she VERB the support of a majority of voters . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if no candidate VERB a majority in the first round of voting , a run - off election is held among the top NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least NUM other characteristics of the u.s. system that are likely to influence party outcomes : the electoral college , VERB NOUN , and campaign and election laws . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , the united states has a presidential system in which the NOUN is selected not directly by the popular vote but ADV by a group of NOUN known collectively as the electoral college . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the best - known party NOUN occurred when democrats moved to include african americans and other NOUN into their national NOUN during the great depression . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after the civil war , republicans , the party of lincoln , were viewed as the party that had freed the slaves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> roosevelt won the election with almost NUM percent of the popular vote and NUM electoral college votes , compared to NOUN PROPN hoover ’s NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM election is considered an example of a critical election , one that represents a ADJ , clear , and long - term shift in voter NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after this election , the political parties were largely identified as being divided by differences in their members ’ ADJ - economic status . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are part of what is known as the party organization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the party organization is the formal structure of the political party , and its active members are responsible for VERB party behavior and supporting party candidates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is a ADJ component of any successful party because it VERB most of the responsibility for building and VERB the party “ NOUN . ” it also plays a key role in helping select , and elect , candidates for public office . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , many americans , especially young people , are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to john green of the ray PROPN PROPN institute of applied politics , “ local elections tend to be about things like NOUN , and NOUN and police protection — which are not as dramatic an issue as same - sex marriage or global NOUN or international affairs . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> elizabeth PROPN , “ NOUN shows generation focuses mostly on social , national issues , ” NOUN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> presidential elections and the behavior of the u.s. congress are also far more likely to make the news NOUN than the activities of county NOUN , and the national - level party organization is mostly responsible for VERB the activities of participants at this level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the national party is a VERB army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to VERB and direct the efforts of the house and senate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the first challenges VERB the party - in - government , or the party NOUN who have been elected or appointed to hold public office , is to achieve their policy goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the means to do this is VERB in NOUN of the NUM major parties ; republican NOUN are called party NOUN and PROPN NOUN are called party NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> key benefits like committee NOUN , leadership positions , and money for important projects in their home district may VERB on legislators following the lead of the party . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these pressures are particularly ADJ for the majority party , so named because it controls more than half the NOUN in NUM of the NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their NOUN to VERB party members who VERB on a particular vote . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for the first few decades of the current pattern of divided government , the threat it VERB to the government appears to have been VERB by a high degree of NOUN , or NOUN through compromise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many NOUN of legislation were passed in the 1960s and 1970s with ADV high levels of support from both parties . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> movements on the left have also VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN wall street movement was born of the government ’s response to the great recession of NUM and its assistance to VERB financial institutions , provided through the PROPN PROPN relief program , PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to ADV regulate the banking industry . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> several VERB theories have been offered . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long NOUN of the voting public , or a change in party NOUN in response to shifts in party position . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ americans have not become more ADV ADJ , ” the washington post , NUM june NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the NOUN NOUN , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before then , it was common for many states to practice NOUN , or NOUN of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost NOUN in the u.s. house of representatives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this can happen once every NUM years as a result of a ADV ADJ NOUN process , in which the number of house NOUN given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to political scientist PROPN PROPN , there is little evidence to support the NOUN hypothesis alone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , he VERB , the senate has become ADJ just as the house of representatives has , but people vote for senators on a ADJ basis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in federalist PROPN NUM , written in the late ADJ century , james madison noted that the formation of self - interested groups , which he called NOUN , was ADJ in any society , as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> interest groups and political parties are NUM of the most easily identified forms of NOUN in the united states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN of american political parties and elections . <sent_end> <sent_begin> new york : PROPN books , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> anti - federalists VERB a more confederate system built on state equality and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN . NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , members of each NOUN quickly VERB that they had a ADJ interest not only in VERB and VERB a president who shared their views , but also in VERB other elections . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM ADV VERB party NOUN , known as the federalists and the democratic - republicans , soon emerged . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federalists VERB in VERB their first leader , john adams , to the presidency in NUM , only to see the democratic - republicans gain victory under thomas jefferson NUM years later in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> andrew jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the electoral college than any other candidate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the house of representatives , as required by the PROPN amendment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN amendment limited the house ’s choice to the NUM candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> new york : PROPN university press , NUM - NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of these positions were given to party NOUN and their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these men were the leaders of political NOUN , organizations that VERB votes for the party ’s candidates or supported the party in other ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perhaps more ADV , this election - focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader NOUN and ADV expanding the range of issues upon which the party was VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> roosevelt attempted to form a third party , known as the progressive party , as an alternative to the more business - ADJ republicans . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN sought to correct the many problems that had VERB as the united states transformed itself from a ADJ , agricultural nation into an increasingly ADJ , ADJ country dominated by big business interests . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on april NUM ( or “ tax day ” ) , NUM , members of the tea party movement VERB at the PROPN state PROPN in PROPN paul in favor of smaller government and against the affordable care act ( left ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM years later , supporters of the law ( right ) demonstrated in front of the u.s. supreme court during ADJ NOUN in national PROPN of independent business v. PROPN , in which the court eventually upheld most provisions of the law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( credit left : modification of work by “ PROPN blue ” / PROPN ; credit right : modification of work by PROPN PROPN ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , a NOUN is someone who represents the interest organization before government , is usually VERB for doing so , and is required to register with the government in which he or she VERB , whether state or federal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN ’s primary goal is usually to influence policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> “ interest groups in the states . ” in politics in the american states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> washington , dc : PROPN press , NUM – NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , interest groups may take the form of membership organizations , which individuals join ADV and to which they usually pay NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns , or who want to be with others who share their views . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> interest groups also include NOUN , which are typically groups of institutions that join with others , often within the same trade or industry ( trade NOUN ) , and have similar concerns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the american PROPN PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . includes PROPN - PROPN , red PROPN north america , PROPN , and PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while VERB policy is the primary goal , interest groups also VERB government activity , serve as a means of political participation for members , and provide information to the public and to lawmakers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the national PROPN of state legislatures , by november NUM , NUM - NUM states had laws requiring that voters provide NOUN at the polls . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( november NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a civil rights group like the national association for the PROPN of colored people ( PROPN ) will keep NOUN of proposed voter - NOUN bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or NOUN of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either VERB money to it or VERB lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such collective goods are benefits — ADJ or ADJ — that help most or all citizens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be ADJ and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often ADJ and thus will be VERB unless there is government involvement . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> group leaders also play an important role in VERB collective action problems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , political scientist robert PROPN suggests that group leaders will offer NOUN to VERB activity among individuals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> robert PROPN , “ an exchange theory of interest groups , ” PROPN journal of political science NUM ( NUM ) : NUM – NUM ; PROPN b. PROPN and james PROPN wilson , “ incentive systems : a theory of organizations , ” administration science PROPN NUM ( NUM ) : NUM – NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some offer material NOUN , which are ADJ benefits of VERB a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , for example , offers NOUN on NOUN NOUN and insurance rates for its members , while NOUN are very low , so they can actually save money by VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather than being a single disturbance , debate about immigration policy has VERB and VERB in recent years , creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when , during his presidential NOUN , donald trump made controversial statements about immigrants , many VERB both for and against him . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN johnson , “ immigration continues to be donald trump ’s NOUN issue , ” washington post , NUM october NUM , NOUN take to the NOUN on different sides of the immigration issue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some argue that the united states is a nation of immigrants , whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB interest groups can help VERB ADJ NOUN , which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some interest groups develop as ADJ movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> interest groups can VERB the NOUN of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , stem cell research is highly ADJ to members of the american PROPN association , an interest organization that represents ADJ NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , different interests represent the more specialized needs of different NOUN within the medical community , but NOUN can occur when a large interest like this has VERB needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such was also the case when several unions split from the PROPN - PROPN ( american PROPN of labor - congress of industrial organizations ) , the nation ’s largest NOUN of unions , in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thomas and PROPN , “ interest groups in the states , ” NUM , NUM , NUM , NUM ; thomas and PROPN , “ NOUN of interest groups and lobbying in the states . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ technology and the development of social media have made it ADJ for smaller groups to form and to attract and communicate with members . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , not all scholars VERB the NOUN that NOUN is natural and that all groups have the potential for access to decision - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the elite NOUN suggests that certain interests , typically businesses and the wealthy , are ADJ and that policies more often reflect their NOUN than anyone else ’s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> political scientist e. e. PROPN noted that “ the NOUN in the ADJ PROPN is that the ADJ NOUN VERB with a strong ADJ NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> e. e. PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while most scholars agree that some interests do have NOUN , others have VERB the ADJ NOUN of certain interests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> additionally , PROPN scholars argue that ADV some interests are in a ADJ position , but these interests do not always get what they want . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> states deep in debt were VERB increasingly ADJ paper currency , many were VERB in interstate trade NOUN with each other , and in western massachusetts , a small group of revolutionary war NOUN ADJ over the NOUN of VERB their NOUN VERB into ADJ open NOUN against the state , in what came to be known as PROPN ’ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN many reached was that the articles of confederation were simply not strong enough to keep the young republic together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the spring of NUM , a convention was called , and delegates from all the states ( except PROPN island , which VERB the convention ) were sent to PROPN to VERB out a solution to this central problem . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of debate over how to VERB power between large and small states was eventually VERB by a third proposal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN compromise , also called the great compromise , proposed a ADJ congress with members VERB differently in each house . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the upper house , the senate , was to have NUM members from each state . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> congressional NOUN today is achieved through the equal NOUN method , which uses a ADJ formula to VERB NOUN based on u.s. PROPN bureau population data , VERB every NUM years as required by the constitution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the close of the first u.s. congress in NUM , there were NUM - NUM representatives , each representing approximately NUM NUM citizens . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while the ADV drawn NOUN VERB in their stated goals , nearly VERB the number of african american representatives in congress in just over NUM decades , they have VERB others who claim they are ADV a new form of an old practice , NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN of legislative district NOUN as a way of VERB a particular candidate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ power is NUM not specifically detailed in the constitution but VERB as necessary to achieve the NOUN of the national government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and an ADJ power , while not enumerated or VERB , must be VERB to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , we will learn about each type of power and the NOUN of NOUN they claim . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but in united states v. PROPN , a decision issued in NUM , the court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional NOUN of the commerce clause . <sent_end> <sent_begin> united states v.

<sent_begin> but presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning , typically at the NOUN of the congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president , it is during NOUN that the chief executive is most powerful and congress least powerful . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , president abraham lincoln , who VERB the NOUN of the civil war , VERB the NOUN of his legal authority in a number of ways , such as by VERB the PROPN proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ abraham lincoln : impact and PROPN , ” PROPN / PROPN / lincoln - impact - and - NOUN ( may NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> following the ADJ NOUN of vietnam and PROPN in the early 1970s , congress attempted to VERB itself as a ADJ branch , even in creating foreign policy , but could not hold back the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the war powers resolution ( covered in the foreign policy chapter ) was intended to VERB congressional war powers but ended up VERB presidential authority in the first NUM days of a military conflict . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the war on NOUN after NUM has also VERB the president ’s hand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another important reform occurred in NUM , when senators john PROPN ( r - PROPN ) and PROPN PROPN ( d - PROPN ) VERB , and congress passed , the PROPN campaign reform act ( PROPN ) , also referred to as the PROPN - PROPN act . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the purpose of this law was to limit the use of “ soft money , ” which is raised for purposes like party - building efforts , get - out - the - vote efforts , and issue - NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the wake of the citizens united decision , a new type of NOUN group emerged , the ADJ PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a traditional PROPN is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or VERB candidates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such pacs VERB to be run by businesses and other groups , like the PROPN union and the national PROPN association , to support their special interests . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> despite the power of the NOUN , however , the most important leadership position in the house is actually elected by the entire body of representatives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this position is called the speaker of the house and is the only house NOUN mentioned in the constitution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the constitution does not require the speaker to be a member of the house , although to date , all NUM - NUM NOUN have been . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , the majority rules the day in the house , like a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the majority side , because it holds the NOUN , the majority leader also has considerable power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , ADV , the majority leader tends to be in the best position to VERB the NOUN when the current speaker steps down . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are well over NUM NUM committees , NOUN , select committees , and joint committees in the congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the core committees are called standing committees . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM standing committees in the house and NUM in the senate ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , republican PROPN PROPN of PROPN ( a ) , the NOUN of the senate judiciary committee , refused to hold NOUN on the nomination of PROPN PROPN to the supreme court , despite the NOUN of his committee NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN , PROPN met with numerous senators , such as republican PROPN PROPN of PROPN ( b ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once NOUN have been completed , the bill enters the ADJ stage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is essentially an VERB and voting process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB NOUN , the senate had to get a NUM - NOUN majority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from VERB the senate floor , with the ADJ exception of senator PROPN PROPN ’s record NUM - NUM - hour NOUN of the civil rights act . in NUM , after the VERB NOUN of the civil rights era , the senate further VERB the NOUN by reducing the number needed for NOUN from NUM - NOUN to NUM - NOUN , or NUM votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial NOUN for which only NUM - NUM votes are needed to VERB NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , NOUN are not VERB on the annual budget PROPN act ( the PROPN act of NUM was the act under which the VERB legislation for PROPN was passed ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a VERB moment for the NOUN , senator PROPN PROPN of south carolina VERB for NUM - NUM hours and NUM NOUN against a weak civil rights bill in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN of segregation and white NOUN , PROPN had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some interests groups form political action committees ( pacs ) , groups that VERB funds from NOUN and VERB them to candidates who support their issues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as [ link ] makes ADJ , many large corporations like PROPN international , PROPN , and PROPN martin form pacs to VERB money to candidates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other pacs are either ADV or ADV oriented . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or NOUN of anti - tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to VERB the proposed legislation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prior to the election in NUM , political NOUN PROPN PROPN , the NOUN of americans for tax reform ( PROPN ) , VERB all republican members of congress to sign a “ PROPN protection PROPN ” that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to VERB any NOUN that were not VERB by tax cuts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM - NUM percent of the republicans in congress signed the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ PROPN : PROPN PROPN just a PUNCT random ’ PROPN , ” washington times , NUM november NUM , PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some interests arise solely to VERB legislation and go ADJ after they achieve their immediate NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are not VERB the liberty of VERB their own reason and NOUN while acting as representatives in congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the NOUN model of representation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , proper representation for some is VERB in the racial , ADJ , ADJ , gender , and sexual identity of the representatives themselves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this form of representation is called ADJ representation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN was formed by PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) , PROPN PROPN , PROPN PROPN , and other leading NOUN to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN PROPN ( d - PROPN ) ( [ link ] ) , the first ADJ american woman elected to congress , was the NOUN of the education amendments act of NUM , title PROPN of which VERB sex discrimination in education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her NOUN , when she opposed racial segregation in NOUN housing while a student at the university of PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> and as representatives of their constituents , they are charged with VERB those constituents ’ interests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , this job has included what some have ADV called “ VERB home the NOUN ” but what many ( usually those outside the district in question ) call NOUN - NOUN politics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a term and a practice , NOUN - NOUN politics — federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents — has been around since the nineteenth century , when NOUN of NOUN NOUN were both a sign of wealth and a system of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> indeed , when the NOUN are VERB , the NUM ADJ NOUN are at NUM percent in NUM and NUM percent in NUM ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , according to PROPN polling , the rise in approval VERB a similar rise in other mood measures , including president bill clinton ’s approval NOUN and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , approval VERB after the september NUM NOUN attacks and the bush administration VERB the " war on PROPN , " VERB troops first to PROPN and later to iraq . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the articles of confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to VERB the VERB NOUN of the confederation congress , who also VERB other ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> articles of confederation , article PROPN , NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the presidency was proposed early in the constitutional convention in PROPN by virginia ’s PROPN PROPN , as part of james madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the virginia plan . <sent_end> <sent_begin> madison offered a rather ADJ NOUN of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he proposed that congress select the executive , whose powers and authority , and even length of term of service , were left largely ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by early september , the electoral college had emerged as the way to select a president for NUM years who was eligible for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this should have meant that texas ’s NUM electoral votes could have VERB to only NUM or the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB this problem and had earlier VERB to vote in PROPN , where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , “ court : PROPN is PROPN PROPN , ” PROPN news , NUM december NUM , PROPN ( may NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it ’s hard to imagine that the NUM presidential election could have been even more ADJ than it was , but NOUN to that ADV ADJ rule in article ii of the constitution , that was a real possibility . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an important means of VERB that no president could become ADJ was to build into the constitution a clear process for VERB the chief executive — impeachment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> impeachment is the act of VERB a government official with ADJ NOUN ; the constitution VERB this NOUN high crimes and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most recent impeachment was of president bill clinton , brought on by his NOUN about an ADJ NOUN with a white house NOUN named PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> house republicans felt the NOUN and clinton ’s initial public NOUN of it VERB to a level of NOUN ADJ of impeachment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> later presidents built on the foundation of these powers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some ADJ ADJ NOUN , as john adams did against the french in the PROPN - war ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> others agreed to VERB for significant ADJ gains , as thomas jefferson did when he VERB the purchase of PROPN from france . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> james PROPN used his annual message in NUM to VERB that the united states would consider it an ADJ act of aggression for european powers to VERB in the affairs of the nations of the western PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> later VERB the PROPN doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of american power in the twentieth century . <sent_end> <sent_begin> andrew jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative NOUN with which he did not agree and VERB ADV when it came to VERB federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the bank of the united states . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the NOUN or large - scale NOUN was made up of legislators in the congress who met ADV to decide on NOUN from their ADJ parties . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rise of the primary system during the progressive era came at the cost of party NOUN ’ control of the process of candidate selection . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some party NOUN even allow ADJ NOUN or members of the opposite party to vote . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when washington VERB to run again after NUM terms , matters VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , political NOUN john adams and thomas jefferson were elected president and vice president , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet the NUM men VERB to work well together during adams ’s administration , much of which jefferson spent at his virginia NOUN at PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> following the NUM presidential election , when then - governor george w. bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a NUM fewer individual votes than his NOUN , ADJ voters called for electoral college reform . <sent_end> <sent_begin> years later , however , nothing of any NOUN had been done . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the PROPN PROPN PROPN is an example of a ADJ organization ; its members ' belief in white NOUN has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech . <sent_end> <sent_begin> institutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the NOUN of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the ADJ number of black men arrested , charged , and VERB of crimes may reflect racial NOUN , a form of institutional racism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , when a NOUN VERB by race individuals VERB of a crime , it may VERB stereotypes of a certain minority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another example of ADJ practices is racial NOUN , in which real NOUN NOUN direct ADJ NOUN toward or away from certain NOUN based on their race . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ attitudes and beliefs are often more ADJ and ADJ to VERB down than specific ADJ practices . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ferguson ’s racial NOUN may explain in part why , even though in NUM only about NUM percent of its population was black , in NUM blacks were VERB in NUM percent of NOUN , NUM percent of NOUN , and NUM percent of NOUN ( PROPN PROPN general ’s office NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , de X segregation in ferguson ’s schools , a race - based wealth gap , urban NOUN , and a black unemployment rate NUM times that of the white unemployment rate VERB existing racial NOUN in ferguson while also VERB ADJ racial NOUN ( PROPN NUM PROPN PROPN PROPN has chinese , PROPN , african american , native american , and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals with multiple ADJ NOUN are becoming more common . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , the ADJ NOUN of a ADJ ( usually ADJ ) group , is the most ADJ NOUN relationship . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , we can see that NOUN has included both the NOUN to VERB a group and the function of NOUN of a group , ADJ or not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is represented by the ideal of the united states as a “ PROPN PROPN ” : a great mixture of different cultures where each culture VERB its own identity and yet VERB to the NOUN of the whole . <sent_end> <sent_begin> true NOUN is characterized by ADJ respect on the part of all cultures , both dominant and ADJ , creating a ADJ environment of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN americans ADV have been subject to their share of racial prejudice , despite the ADV positive NOUN as the model minority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the model minority NOUN is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching significant educational , ADJ , and ADJ levels without challenging the existing establishment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> other NOUN agencies frequently use the NOUN PROPN and PROPN , which VERB for “ ADJ , gay , PROPN , PROPN ” ( and “ PROPN ” or “ VERB ” when the q is ADV , it is clear that gay and ADJ couples are ADV affected in states where they are denied the legal right to marriage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the defense of marriage act ( PROPN ) was passed , ADV limiting the definition of “ marriage ” to a union between NUM man and NUM woman . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it also allowed individual states to choose whether or not they recognized same - sex NOUN performed in other states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is not the same as ADJ , and many ADJ males view both their sex and gender as male . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gender stereotypes form the basis of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to ADJ beliefs that value NUM sex over another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it varies in its level of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the social construction of NOUN refers to the way in which ADV created NOUN about the cultural NOUN of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and NOUN that link male and female behavior to biological NOUN , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN of france was the world 's ADJ living person until she VERB at NUM years old ; there are ADV NUM women in the world whose NOUN are well VERB as NUM years or older ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are people living to NUM years or more . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in august NUM , there were NUM - NUM VERB NOUN worldwide — NUM - NUM women and NUM men . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social NOUN refers to a specialized field of NOUN that VERB the social ( and sociological ) aspects of aging . <sent_end> <sent_begin> researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the experiences of people at specific NOUN , such as mental and physical NOUN , plus age - specific concerns such as the process of VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN PROPN particular interest to NOUN today is the population of NOUN NOUN , the NOUN born between NUM and NUM and now reaching their NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> coming of age in the 1960s and early 1970s , the NOUN NOUN generation was the first group of children and NOUN with their own spending power and therefore their own NOUN power ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is ADJ to understand aging in the context of these phases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a life course is the period from birth to death , including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each phase comes with different responsibilities and expectations , which of course vary by individual and culture . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for many NOUN and young adults , VERB a NOUN or another older relative can be the first loss of a VERB one they experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it may be their first NOUN with NOUN , a psychological , emotional , and social response to the feelings of loss that VERB death or a similar event . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the changing concept of NOUN is an NOUN of our society ’s changing view of death . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is a type of healthcare that VERB ADV ADJ people when “ NOUN - oriented NOUN ” are no longer an NOUN ( PROPN foundation of america NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in early societies , the elderly were VERB and VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many ADJ societies observed NOUN , a type of social structure ADV the power is held by a society ’s ADJ members . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some countries today , the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the social NOUN that PROPN and henry recognized ( NUM ) , and its NOUN that elderly people need to find NOUN roles for those they VERB lost , is VERB ADV in activity theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this theory , activity levels and social involvement are key to this process , and key to happiness ( PROPN NUM ; PROPN NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory ( PROPN , johnson , and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> though it may seem obvious now , with our awareness of NOUN , age stratification theorists were the first to suggest that members of society might be VERB by age , just as they are VERB by race , class , and gender . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is ADJ NOUN with NOUN theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN ( NUM ) based their theory on the idea that successful personal development throughout the life course and subsequent NOUN of the challenges associated with everyday life are based on the components of selection , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologists , on the other hand , tend to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict NOUN of status roles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here , we VERB define family as a ADV recognized group ( usually VERB by blood , marriage , NOUN , or NOUN ) that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> marriage PROPN single NOUN and NOUN ( when a NOUN VERB a NOUN but not a marriage ) becoming more acceptable in recent years , people may be less motivated to get married . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a recent survey , NUM percent of NOUN VERB “ INTJ ” when VERB whether marriage is becoming ADJ ( PROPN research center NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instances of NOUN are almost ADV in the form of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to a man being married to more than NUM woman at the same time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the reverse , when a woman is married to more than NUM man at the same time , is called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both ADJ and ADJ NOUN are considered part of one ’s family . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this pattern of VERB NOUN is called ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that NOUN , or one ’s ADJ NOUN , can be based on blood or marriage or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM types of ADJ NOUN : ADJ , which follows the NOUN ’s line only ; ADJ , which follows the mother ’s side only ; and PROPN , which follows either the NOUN ’s only or the mother ’s side only , depending on the situation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ societies , such as those in ADJ china and PROPN , only males carry on the family NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today , however , these models have been VERB for their linear and ADJ NOUN as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while VERB some of these once - popular theories , it is important to identify their NOUN and NOUN . the set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family life cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the first NOUN of the family life cycle was developed by paul PROPN in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of these children , NUM percent live with NOUN , NUM percent live with other NOUN , and NUM percent live with NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this family structure is referred to as the extended family , and may include NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN living in the same home . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ parents account for about a NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some people associate religion with places of NOUN ( a NOUN or church ) , others with a practice ( NOUN or NOUN ) , and still others with a concept that VERB their daily lives ( like NOUN or NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs , values , and practices VERB what a person holds ADJ or VERB to be ADV significant . does religion bring fear , NOUN , relief , explanation of the ADJ or control over freedom and choice ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> how do our religious NOUN affect our behavior ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another NOUN of religious beliefs is the creation NOUN we find in different NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> religious NOUN are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group , such as bar NOUN or NOUN of NOUN ( PROPN and PROPN PROPN history of religion as a sociological PROPN the wake of nineteenth century european NOUN and NOUN , NUM social theorists attempted to VERB the relationship between religion and society : PROPN durkheim , PROPN PROPN , and PROPN marx . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are among the VERB NOUN of modern sociology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN do not grow into NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociologists call these established NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> established NOUN , such as the PROPN or PROPN ’s NOUN fall ADV between NOUN and NOUN on the NOUN – NOUN NOUN because they have a mixture of NOUN - like and NOUN - like characteristics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> note that some NOUN may be VERB — or understood — in various categories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , the christian NOUN of the PROPN PROPN ( god , PROPN , PROPN PROPN ) VERB the definition of NOUN , which is a religion based on belief in a single NOUN , to some scholars . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , many PROPN view the multiple NOUN of PROPN ’s NOUN as ADJ , which is a religion based on belief in multiple NOUN , , while PROPN might describe those NOUN are a ADJ parallel to the christian PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some japanese practice PROPN , which follows NOUN , which is a religion that VERB in the NOUN of ADJ NOUN , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice NOUN believe in a ADJ connection between humans and other natural NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is also important to note that every society also has NOUN , such as NOUN , who do not believe in a ADJ being or NOUN , and NOUN , who hold that ADJ reality ( such as god ) is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while typically not an organized group , NOUN and NOUN represent a significant portion of the population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> education is a social institution through which a society ’s children are VERB basic ADJ knowledge , learning skills , and cultural norms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> every nation in the world is VERB with some form of education system , though those systems vary greatly . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values , beliefs , and social norms of their culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both ADJ and formal education include cultural transmission . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another role of schools , according to ADJ theory , is that of NOUN , or VERB students based on ADJ NOUN or potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most capable students are identified early in schools through NOUN and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this ADJ NOUN VERB the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to VERB status ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conflict theorists point to NOUN , a ADJ NOUN system that places students on “ NOUN ” ( ADJ versus low NOUN ) that VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while NOUN may believe that students do better in VERB classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from NOUN , conflict theorists feel that NOUN leads to self - VERB NOUN in which students live up ( or down ) to NOUN and societal expectations ( education week NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN in the PROPN report were so powerful that they brought about NUM major changes to education in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the federal head start program , which is still active and successful today , was developed to give low - income students an opportunity to make up the NOUN deficit discussed in PROPN ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the program provides ADV - VERB NOUN to students of low ADJ status . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> government leaders might have this kind of influence as well , but they also have the advantage of VERB power associated with their position in the government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as this example indicates , there is more than NUM type of authority in a community . authority refers to accepted power — that is , power that people agree to follow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people VERB to authority NOUN because they feel that these individuals are ADJ of respect . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN VERB the power of ADJ authority because they are drawn to the leader ’s personal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a ADJ leader can be ADJ , and can VERB NOUN to make unusual NOUN or to VERB in the NOUN of great NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the power held by these positions varies from NUM country to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV speaking , a NOUN is a government in which a single person ( a NOUN ) rules until he or she VERB or VERB the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> usually , a NOUN claims the rights to the title by way of ADJ NOUN or as a result of some NOUN of ADJ NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the power in an NOUN is held by a small , elite group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike in a NOUN , members of an NOUN do not necessarily achieve their NOUN based on NOUN to ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a democracy is a form of government that VERB to provide all citizens with an equal voice , or vote , in determining state policy , regardless of their level of ADJ status . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and NOUN of a just and ADJ constitution that VERB the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV before the voting rights act was passed , the NUM u.s. supreme court case PROPN v. PROPN changed the nature of elections . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN decision VERB the NOUN of “ NUM person , NUM vote , ” a concept holding that all people ’s votes should be counted equally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before this decision , ADJ NOUN of population VERB small groups of people in ADV ADJ ADJ areas to have as much voting power as the ADJ populations of urban areas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we use a variety of cues in a visual NOUN to establish our sense of depth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of these are NOUN cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM example of a NOUN depth NOUN is NOUN NOUN , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the inner ear contains the semi - circular NOUN , which are involved in balance and movement ( the ADJ sense ) , and the cochlea . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cochlea is a fluid - filled , NOUN - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we VERB discuss NUM of them here : temporal theory and place theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the temporal theory of NOUN perception VERB that frequency is VERB by the activity level of a sensory neuron . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this would mean that a given hair cell would fire action NOUN related to the frequency of the sound wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB sound could be considered similar to the way that we VERB depth in our visual fields . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like the ADJ and ADJ cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both ADJ ( NUM - ADJ ) and ADJ ( NUM - ADJ ) cues to VERB sound . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the partial or complete inability to hear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some people are born NOUN , which is known as ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the hearing problem is associated with a failure to VERB ADJ signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called ADJ hearing loss . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM disease that results in ADJ hearing loss is PROPN 's disease . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this kind of loss can not be treated with hearing PROPN , but some individuals might be candidates for a ADJ NOUN as a treatment NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN are ADJ NOUN that consist of a NOUN , a speech NOUN , and an ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the device receives ADJ sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to VERB information to the brain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you have learned since ADJ school that there are NUM basic NOUN of taste : ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research VERB , however , that we have at least NUM taste NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is our fifth taste . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> olfactory receptor cells are located in a ADJ membrane at the top of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> small hair - like NOUN from these receptors serve as the sites for NOUN molecules VERB in the NOUN to interact with chemical receptors located on these NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these receptors include PROPN ’s NOUN , ADJ NOUN , PROPN ’s NOUN , and PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN respond to pressure and lower frequency NOUN , and ADJ NOUN detect ADJ pressure and higher frequency NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN respond to light pressure , while PROPN NOUN detect NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each ADJ to specific NOUN - related stimuli . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> generally speaking , pain can be considered to be ADJ or ADJ in nature . <sent_end> <sent_begin> pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as ADJ pain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some situations , pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ sense VERB to our ability to maintain balance and body NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as [ link ] shows , the major sensory organs ( PROPN , PROPN , and the NUM ADJ NOUN ) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM PROPN principle is the figure - ground relationship . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this principle , we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM additional PROPN principles are the law of NOUN ( or good NOUN ) and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the law of NOUN suggests that we are more likely to VERB continuous , smooth VERB lines rather than ADJ , broken lines ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you probably feel fairly certain that your perception ADV VERB the real world , but this is not always the case . <sent_end> <sent_begin> our perceptions are based on ADJ NOUN : VERB NOUN that we make while VERB sensory information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are VERB by a number of factors , including our NOUN , experiences , and expectations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both NOUN and NOUN are innate behaviors that organisms are born with . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are a motor or ADJ reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they tend to be ADJ than NOUN , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the NOUN - NOUN NOUN and the contraction of the NOUN in ADJ light ) , and involve more ADJ centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> our NOUN have a natural tendency to VERB events that occur closely together or in sequence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you will see that ADJ learning is central to all NUM basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , NOUN conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and ADJ learning VERB social and cognitive layers to all the basic ADJ processes , both conscious and unconscious . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , a ADJ scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as we discussed ADV in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , ADV , to VERB events . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ’s research on the digestive system of dogs ADV led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN would sound a tone ( like VERB a bell ) and then give the dogs the NOUN NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the tone was the neutral stimulus ( PROPN ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally VERB a response . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prior to conditioning , the dogs did not VERB when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN will learn to get excited when she VERB the “ NOUN ” of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB a new neutral stimulus ( “ NOUN ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ PROPN ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can NOUN to condition another stimulus : the ADJ NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> soon the dogs VERB VERB to the tone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the ADJ stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the NOUN , NOUN , or other organism would show a ADJ and ADJ response , and finally no response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , when an organism VERB the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus NOUN , the opposite of stimulus discrimination . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> his idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are VERB to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by ADJ consequences are less likely to be repeated ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> essentially , if an organism does something that VERB about a VERB result , the organism is more likely to do it again . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> remember that reinforcement , even when it is negative , always increases a behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in positive punishment , you add an ADJ stimulus to decrease a behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM his NOUN conditioning experiments , skinner often used an approach called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead of VERB only the target behavior , in VERB , we VERB ADJ NOUN of a target behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> why is VERB needed ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with a variable NOUN reinforcement schedule , the person or animal VERB the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time , which are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> say that PROPN is the NOUN at a ADJ - food NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although strict NOUN such as skinner and PROPN refused to believe that NOUN ( such as thoughts and expectations ) plays a role in learning , another NOUN , PROPN PROPN PROPN , had a different opinion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s experiments with NOUN demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> previous NOUN of this chapter focused on classical and NOUN conditioning , which are forms of ADJ learning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ learning , we learn by VERB others and then VERB , or NOUN , what they do or say . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the individuals VERB the VERB behavior are called models . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and other researchers proposed a NOUN of NOUN called social learning theory , which took cognitive processes into account . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN , ADJ NOUN could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that ADJ learning involves much more than NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what are the NOUN of this study ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB that we VERB and learn , and that this learning can have both ADJ and ADJ effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( positive ) models can be used to encourage ADV acceptable behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the different NOUN stored in the NOUN NOUN are called concepts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> concepts are categories or NOUN of ADJ information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> concepts are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by VERB NOUN , and VERB and VERB these NOUN into cognitive structures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ concept , on the other hand , is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> various properties of ADJ shapes , like NOUN and NOUN , serve as useful examples of ADJ concepts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , NOUN is a language ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the set of rules that are used to VERB meaning through the use of the NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , english NOUN VERB that most NOUN receive an “ PUNCT ” at the end to indicate past ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN are part of a language ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the process by which we VERB meaning from NOUN and words . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the way words are organized into NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> b. f. skinner ( NUM ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) VERB this NOUN approach , VERB instead that the mechanisms underlying language NOUN are ADV determined . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the use of language develops in the absence of formal NOUN and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from ADV different cultures and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a well - known strategy is trial and error . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the old NOUN , “ if at first you do n’t VERB , try , try again ” describes trial and error . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN may be challenging your VERB bias . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an VERB bias occurs when you focus on NUM piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , you VERB so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN bias is the tendency to focus on information that VERB your existing beliefs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other words , you VERB all along that things would turn out the way they did . <sent_end> <sent_begin> representative bias describes a ADJ way of thinking , in which you ADV VERB someone or something ; for example , you may VERB that your NOUN spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual NOUN , because the idea of them spending their time VERB NOUN or VERB an NOUN NOUN does not fit in with your stereotypes of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN describes the NOUN or needs that direct behavior toward a goal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition to biological NOUN , NOUN can be ADJ ( VERB from internal factors ) or ADJ ( VERB from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring , while ADV motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to the drive theory of NOUN , NOUN from NOUN create physiological needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and , ultimately , bring the system back to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> self - NOUN is an individual ’s belief in her own NOUN to complete a task , which may include a previous successful NOUN of the ADJ task or a similar task . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) VERB that an individual ’s sense of self - NOUN plays a ADJ role in VERB behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the NOUN , PROPN PROPN proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into NUM components : VERB intelligence and fluid intelligence ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to VERB it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when you learn , remember , and recall information , you are using VERB intelligence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> practical intelligence , as proposed by PROPN , is sometimes compared to “ street NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> being practical means you find NOUN that work in your everyday life by VERB knowledge based on your experiences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of NOUN ; individuals who VERB high in practical intelligence may or may not have ADJ NOUN in ADJ and ADJ intelligence ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> multiple PROPN theory was developed by PROPN PROPN , a PROPN psychologist and former student of PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s theory , which has been VERB for more than NUM years , is a more recent development among theories of intelligence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the ability to generate , create , or VERB new ideas , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> very ADJ people often have ADJ knowledge about something , work on it for years , look at ADJ NOUN , seek out the NOUN and help of other NOUN , and take NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for most people , once they have VERB , they feel NOUN , or NOUN and satisfaction , and their eating behavior VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like the initiation of eating , NOUN is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> our energy expenditure is ADV affected by our levels of activity , but our body ’s metabolic rate also comes into play . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person ’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is VERB in a given period of time , and there is ADJ individual NOUN in our metabolic rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with high rates of metabolism are able to VERB off NOUN more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to the centers for disease control and PROPN ( PROPN ) , an adult with a body mass index ( PROPN ) between NUM and NUM is considered ADJ ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an adult with a PROPN of NUM or higher is considered ADJ ( centers for disease control and PROPN [ PROPN ] , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people who are so ADJ that they are at risk for death are classified as ADV ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN - PROPN syndrome ( PROPN ) is a genetic disorder that results in ADJ feelings of ADJ NOUN and reduced rates of metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> typically , affected children have to be VERB around the NOUN to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through NOUN and/or excessive exercise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals VERB from NOUN NOUN often have a ADJ body image , VERB in NOUN as a type of body NOUN , meaning that they view themselves as ADJ even though they are not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN also developed a NOUN known as the PROPN scale that is still commonly used today to VERB an individual ’s sexual orientation ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sexual orientation is an individual ’s emotional and ADJ NOUN to same - VERB individuals ( ADJ ) , opposite - VERB individuals ( ADJ ) , or both ( ADJ ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> based on these observations , PROPN and johnson divided the sexual response cycle into NUM phases that are fairly similar in men and women : NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and resolution ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by NOUN of the NOUN or NOUN and NOUN and expansion of the ADJ canal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during NOUN , women experience further NOUN of the NOUN and increased blood flow to the NOUN NOUN , and men experience full NOUN and often exhibit pre - ADJ fluid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in men , ADJ NOUN are VERB by a NOUN of ADJ fluid near the NOUN that is ultimately forced out by NOUN of ADJ muscles , ( i.e. , NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> resolution is the relatively rapid return to an ADJ state VERB by a decrease in blood pressure and ADJ relaxation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while many women can quickly VERB the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer ADJ period as part of resolution . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when individuals do not feel ADJ VERB with the gender associated with their biological sex , then they experience gender NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gender NOUN is a diagnostic category in the fifth NOUN of the diagnostic and statistical PROPN of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would VERB they are . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN must VERB for at least NUM months and result in significant distress or NOUN to meet dsm-5 diagnostic NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a result , the test was VERB and ADJ , which means that the test was VERB ADV to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of NOUN resulted in a bell curve ( bell curves will be discussed later ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN means that the manner of administration , VERB , and interpretation of results is consistent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected VERB groups , such as age groups . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> without a large sample size , it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the ADJ population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a representative sample is a NOUN of the population that ADV represents the general population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if , for example , you measured the height of the women in your NOUN only , you might not actually have a representative sample . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN - PROPN NUM - factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this theory , emotions are composed of NUM factors : physiological and cognitive . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the biology of emotions <sent_end> <sent_begin> earlier , you learned about the ADJ system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ system includes the hypothalamus , thalamus , NOUN , and the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is critical for classical conditioning and for VERB emotional value to learning processes and memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the central nucleus plays a role in attention , and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various NOUN areas to regulate the ADJ nervous and endocrine systems ’ activity ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in VERB emotional NOUN is universal , and indeed , this idea was suggested in the late ADJ century in charles PROPN ’s book the expression of emotions in man and animals ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in fact , there is substantial evidence for NUM universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these include : happiness , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and anger ( [ link ] ) ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> personality refers to the long - standing traits and patterns that VERB individuals to ADV think , feel , and behave in specific ways . <sent_end> <sent_begin> our personality is what makes us unique individuals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to freud , unconscious NOUN influenced by sex and aggression , along with childhood NOUN , are the forces that influence our personality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> freud VERB many NOUN who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these theorists , referred to as PROPN - PROPN , generally agreed with freud that childhood experiences matter , but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the unconscious i d contains our most ADJ NOUN or NOUN , and is present from birth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB NOUN for NOUN , NOUN , and sex . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to freud , a person who has a strong NOUN , which can balance the demands of the i d and the NOUN , has a healthy personality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> freud maintained that NOUN in the system can lead to NOUN ( a tendency to experience negative emotions ) , anxiety disorders , or ADJ behaviors . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a person who is dominated by their i d might be ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , a person VERB to VERB her own unconscious feelings and instead VERB those feelings in someone else . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other defense mechanisms include NOUN , displacement , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after passing through the ADJ stage , children enter what freud termed the ADJ stage ( NUM years ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this stage , children experience NOUN in their NOUN and bladder movements , so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the final stage is the ADJ stage ( from NOUN on ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this stage , there is a sexual NOUN as the ADJ NOUN VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he ADV founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to VERB for feelings of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM , NUM ) proposed the concept of the NOUN complex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN complex refers to a person ’s feelings that they lack worth and do n’t measure up to the standards of others or of society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory NOUN , which are common to all of us ( PROPN , NUM ) . these ADJ memories , which PROPN called NOUN , are represented by universal NOUN in various cultures , as expressed through NOUN , art , and dreams ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> memory is an information processing system ; therefore , we often compare it to a computer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> memory is the set of processes used to VERB , store , and VERB information over different periods of time ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves the input of information into the memory system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> storage is the NOUN of the VERB information . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it probably required a NOUN of work and attention on your part in order to VERB that information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as ADJ processing ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and PROPN VERB that we process ADJ information best through ADJ NOUN , especially if we apply what is called the self - reference effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the self - reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that VERB to PRON in NOUN to material that has less personal NOUN ( rogers , PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> could VERB NOUN be beneficial to you as you attempt to VERB the concepts in this chapter ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through NUM distinct stages : sensory memory , short - term memory , and finally long - term memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these stages were first proposed by richard PROPN and richard PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> their model of human memory ( [ link ] ) , called PROPN - PROPN ( a - s ) , is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> short - term memory ( PROPN ) is a ADJ storage system that processes ADJ sensory memory ; sometimes it is called working memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> short - term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes VERB that memory to something already in long - term memory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> understanding the different types is important because a person ’s age or particular types of brain NOUN or disorders can leave certain types of PROPN ADJ while having ADJ consequences for other types . <sent_end> <sent_begin> explicit memories are those we ADV try to remember and recall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if you are studying for your NOUN NOUN , the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we ADV experienced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> explicit ( ADJ ) memory has NUM parts : ADJ memory and ADJ memory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life — NOUN , NOUN , NOUN choices , NOUN conditions , and so on ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> most likely NOUN of us could even come close to VERB these questions ; however , american NOUN PROPN PROPN , best known for the television show PROPN , can remember . <sent_end> <sent_begin> she has an ADJ and highly ADJ ADJ memory ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM ways you can VERB information out of your long - term memory storage system : recall , recognition , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall is what we most often think about when we VERB about memory NOUN : it means you can access information without cues . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , you would use recall for an NOUN test . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN began VERB this problem , about NUM years ago , by making NOUN in the NOUN of animals such as NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he was VERB for evidence of the NOUN : the group of neurons that serve as the “ physical representation of memory ” ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , PROPN ( NUM ) VERB NOUN to find their way through a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another group of researchers also VERB with NOUN to learn how the NOUN functions in memory processing ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they created NOUN in the NOUN of the NOUN , and found that the NOUN demonstrated memory NOUN on various tasks , such as object recognition and NOUN running . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is also believed that strong emotions VERB the formation of strong memories , and ADJ emotional experiences form ADJ memories ; this is called arousal theory ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , strong emotional experiences can VERB the release of neurotransmitters , as well as hormones , which VERB memory ; therefore , our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non - emotional event . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN agreed with skinner that personality develops through learning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he VERB , however , with skinner ’s strict NOUN approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM , NUM ) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development , and most recently has focused on the concept of self - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> self - NOUN is our level of NOUN in our own NOUN , developed through our social experiences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> self - NOUN affects how we approach challenges and reach goals . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN was a student of PROPN PROPN and VERB for years at PROPN , where he was a NOUN of PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB several decades of ADJ psychological NOUN regarding trait NOUN of behavior , and his NOUN VERB the NOUN of personality psychology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with ADJ NOUN can not remember some or even all of their past . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in studying cases where dna evidence has VERB people from crimes , the PROPN project discovered that NOUN NOUN is the leading cause of ADJ NOUN ( PROPN PROPN PROPN school of law , PROPN university , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall of false ADJ memories is called false memory syndrome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this syndrome has received a NOUN of NOUN , particularly as it VERB to memories of events that do not have independent NOUN — often the only NOUN to the abuse are the NOUN and the NOUN ( e.g. , sexual abuse ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> i know i read the book in high school , and i remember that NUM of the main NOUN is named PROPN , and her NOUN is an NOUN , but i ADV do n’t remember PRON else . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB if his mother actually read the book , and his mother is ADJ she VERB n’t recall the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what is going on here is storage decay : ADJ information tends to VERB with the passage of time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , german psychologist PROPN PROPN VERB the process of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , he VERB NOUN of NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> memories can also be affected by bias , which is the final NOUN error . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ( NUM ) says that your feelings and view of the world can actually VERB your memory of past events . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these are examples of ADJ interference : when old information VERB the recall of newly learned information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ interference happens when information learned more recently VERB the recall of older information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , this week you are studying about freud ’s PROPN theory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another ADJ NOUN was PROPN rogers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of rogers ’s main ideas about personality VERB self - concept , our thoughts and feelings about PRON . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how would you respond to the question , “ who AUX i ? ” your answer can show how you see PRON . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to rogers ( NUM ) , “ as NOUN are accepted and VERB , they tend to develop a more ADJ NOUN ADP themselves ” ( NOUN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , when there is a great NOUN between our ideal and actual NOUN , we experience a state rogers called NOUN , which can lead to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both rogers ’s and PROPN ’s theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what does the study of biology share with other scientific NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> science ( from the latin X , meaning “ knowledge ” ) can be defined as knowledge that covers general NOUN or the operation of general laws , especially when acquired and VERB by the scientific method . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a hypothesis may become a VERB theory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a theory is a VERB and VERB explanation for observations or phenomena . <sent_end> <sent_begin> science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to VERB the nature of the universe . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ hypothesis must be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it should also be ADJ , meaning that it can be VERB by experimental results . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , science does not claim to “ VERB ” PRON because scientific NOUN are always subject to modification with further information . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> basic science or “ ADJ ” science VERB to expand knowledge regardless of the short - term application of that knowledge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , most scientists present their results in NOUN - VERB NOUN that are published in scientific NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - VERB NOUN are scientific papers that are VERB by a scientist ’s NOUN , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are ADJ individuals , often NOUN in the same research area , who judge whether or not the scientist ’s work is ADJ for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires NOUN following the style of the journal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> using the work or ideas of others without proper NOUN is considered NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the results are presented by means of NOUN or NOUN , but no ADJ information should be presented . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the discussion section , the researcher will VERB the results , describe how variables may be related , and attempt to explain the observations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is ADJ to conduct an extensive NOUN search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these conditions may , however , change from NUM moment to the next . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a ADJ range almost ADV , despite environmental changes , through NOUN ( literally , “ ADJ state ” ) — the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least NUM atoms held together by NUM or more chemical bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many molecules that are ADV important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by NOUN ( a NOUN is a large molecule that is made by VERB smaller units called NOUN , which are ADJ than macromolecules ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of a NOUN is NOUN acid ( dna ) ( [ link ] ) , which contains the NOUN for the structure and functioning of all living organisms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic . <sent_end> <sent_begin> prokaryotes are single - ADJ or colonial organisms that do not have membrane - bound nuclei ; in contrast , the cells of NOUN do have membrane - bound organelles and a membrane - bound nucleus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> organs are present not only in animals but also in plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of ADV related organs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mammals have many organ systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , the NOUN with the NOUN trees includes populations of VERB plants and also insects and ADJ populations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a community is the sum of populations VERB a particular area . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , all of the trees , flowers , insects , and other populations in a NOUN form the NOUN ’s community . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the fact that biology , as a science , has such a broad NOUN has to do with the ADJ diversity of life on earth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the source of this diversity is evolution , the process of ADJ change during which new species arise from older species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> evolutionary NOUN study the evolution of living things in everything from the ADJ world to ecosystems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for instance , molecular biology and NOUN study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as dna , rna , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - ADJ organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is quite a broad branch itself , and depending on the subject of study , there are also ADJ NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN , among others . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , another branch of biology , uses NOUN to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN and NOUN are the study of animals and plants , respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can also VERB as NOUN , NOUN , or NOUN , to name just a few areas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to understand how elements come together , we must first discuss the ADJ component or building block of an element , the atom . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an atom is the ADJ unit of matter that VERB all of the chemical properties of an element . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NUM gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid NOUN at room temperature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom VERB significantly to its mass , but not to its charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , VERB only NUM NUM NUM - NUM NOUN , or about NUM / NUM of an atomic mass unit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’s overall atomic mass . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this NOUN of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply VERB the number of protons from the mass number . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since an element ’s NOUN will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> often , the resulting number contains a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the different elements are organized and VERB in the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB by ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) in NUM , the NOUN groups elements that , although unique , share certain chemical properties with other elements . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an early model of the atom was developed in NUM by ADJ scientist PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons , with the electrons in circular NOUN at specific NOUN from the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN form electron NOUN or energy levels , which are a way of VERB the number of electrons in the outermost NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> hydrogen will VERB or share its electron to achieve this NOUN , while NOUN and sodium will VERB their electron to become stable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result of VERB a ADV charged electron , they become ADV charged ions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> group NUM elements , including NOUN and NOUN , have NUM electrons in their ADJ NOUN , so they tend to VERB this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them ADV charged ions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is because it is ADV ADJ for atoms to be in that NOUN and it makes them stable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , since not all elements have enough electrons to VERB their outermost NOUN , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms ADV VERB the electrons they need to VERB a stable electron NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM or more atoms ADV bond with each other , the ADJ chemical structure is a molecule . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the equation below , the reaction includes NUM hydrogen NOUN molecules and NUM water molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is an example of a ADJ chemical equation , ADV the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the law of conservation of matter , the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal , such that no atoms are , under normal circumstances , created or VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN that describe these reactions contain a ADJ NOUN and are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ reactions are those that can go in either direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the NOUN of products and reactants are VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons , each ion has a net charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are positive ions that are formed by VERB electrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> negative ions are formed by VERB electrons and are called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , ADV charged sodium ions and ADV charged NOUN ions bond together to make NOUN of sodium NOUN , or NOUN NOUN , creating a ADJ molecule with NUM net charge . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM types of ADJ bonds : polar and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a polar ADJ bond , shown in [ link ] , the electrons are ADV shared by the atoms and are VERB more to NUM nucleus than the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the ADJ distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( PROPN ) or slightly negative ( NOUN – ) charge develops . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the X the hydrogen from NUM molecule and the NOUN – charge on the more ADJ atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this interaction is called a hydrogen bond . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , non - polar molecules such as NOUN and NOUN do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than VERB in it , as we see in NOUN NOUN containing oil and NOUN ( an ADJ water solution ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADJ compounds are called ADJ ( X = “ water ” ; NUM = “ NOUN ” ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> water also has a high heat of NOUN , the amount of energy required to change NUM NOUN of a liquid substance to a gas . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a considerable amount of heat energy ( NUM NOUN ) is required to VERB this change in water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is referred to as a NOUN of NOUN , or a NOUN shell , as illustrated in [ link ] and serves to keep the particles separated or VERB in the water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when ADJ compounds are added to water , the individual ions VERB with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ADJ bonds are VERB in the process of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these ADJ forces are related to water ’s property of NOUN , or the NOUN between water molecules and other molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN is sometimes stronger than water ’s ADJ forces , especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> using the negative NOUN to generate positive NOUN , high NOUN of hydrogen ions VERB a low NOUN number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( PROPN ) in a solution , usually by having NUM of its hydrogen atoms VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a base provides either NOUN ions ( INTJ – ) or other ADV charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and ADV raising the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are the key . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ADV absorb excess NOUN or PROPN – , keeping the NOUN of the body ADV maintained in the ADJ range required for survival . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB a constant blood NOUN is critical to a person ’s well - being . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so far , the NOUN we have discussed have been ADJ NOUN , which consist of linear NOUN of carbon atoms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another type of NOUN , ADJ NOUN , consists of closed NOUN of carbon atoms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the NOUN ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> structural NOUN ( like NOUN and PROPN shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the NOUN of their ADJ bonds : both molecules have NUM NOUN and NUM NOUN ( PROPN ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , due to their different chemical properties , NOUN is VERB for use as a NOUN for NOUN NOUN and NOUN , whereas PROPN is VERB for use as a NOUN and a NOUN in NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , on the other hand , have similar NOUN of their ADJ bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and VERB specific chemical properties to those molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are found along the “ carbon NOUN ” of macromolecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN combine with each other using ADJ bonds to form larger molecules known as NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN reactions are VERB , or “ VERB up , ” by specific enzymes ; NOUN reactions involve the formation of new bonds , requiring energy , while NOUN reactions break bonds and release energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these reactions are similar for most macromolecules , but each NOUN and NOUN reaction is specific for its class . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN ( NOUN = “ NUM ” ; VERB = “ ADJ ” ) are simple sugars , the most common of which is glucose . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NOUN , the number of NOUN usually VERB from NUM to NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ long chain of NOUN linked by NOUN bonds is known as a NOUN ( X = “ many ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the chain may be VERB or ADJ , and it may contain different types of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN ( insects , NOUN , and others ) have an outer NOUN , called the NOUN , which protects their internal body parts ( as seen in the NOUN in [ link ] ) . this NOUN is made of the biological NOUN NOUN , which is a NOUN - containing nitrogen . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is made of VERB units of n - NOUN - β - d - NOUN , a modified sugar . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some fatty acids have common names that VERB their origin . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , ADJ acid , a VERB fatty acid , is derived from the NOUN tree . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN acid is derived from PROPN PROPN , the scientific name for NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , they have to be VERB through NOUN via the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ fatty acids ( like that shown in [ link ] ) fall into this category and are NUM of only NUM known for humans ( the other being NOUN fatty acid ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are ADJ fatty acids and are called NOUN because the third carbon from the end of the NOUN chain is connected to its NOUN carbon by a double bond . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> unlike the NOUN and NOUN discussed earlier , NOUN have a VERB ring structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although they do not VERB the other lipids , they are VERB with them because they are also ADJ and ADJ in water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> hormones are chemical - signaling molecules , usually small proteins or NOUN , secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes , including growth , development , metabolism , and reproduction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein 's shape , size , and function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a ADJ bond , known as a NOUN bond , which is formed by a NOUN reaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN group of NUM amino acid and the amino group of the ADJ amino acid combine , releasing a molecule of water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the local NOUN of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most common are the α - helix and β - ADJ NOUN structures ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both structures are the α - helix structure — the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the NOUN process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the NOUN process from protein NOUN known as NOUN ( or NOUN ) that associate with the target protein during the NOUN process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they act by preventing NOUN of NOUN that make up the complete protein structure , and they VERB from the protein once the target protein is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the dna molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an NOUN to communicate with the rest of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN is the NOUN rna ( mrna ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other types of rna — like PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN — are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN are classified as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the primary structure of a NOUN is NUM carbon - nitrogen NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this way , the mrna is read and the protein product is made . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN rna ( PROPN ) is a major NOUN of NOUN on which the mrna binds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the proper NOUN of the mrna and the NOUN ; the NOUN of the NOUN also has an ADJ activity ( PROPN PROPN ) and VERB the formation of the NOUN bonds between NUM aligned amino acids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with few NOUN , individual cells can not be seen with the ADJ eye , so scientists use NOUN ( X = “ small ” ; X = “ to look at ” ) to study them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a microscope is an NOUN that VERB an object . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most NOUN of cells are taken with a microscope , and these images can also be called NOUN . the NOUN of a microscope ’s NOUN change the orientation of the image that the NOUN VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by the late NOUN , NOUN PROPN PROPN and NOUN PROPN PROPN were studying tissues and proposed the ADJ cell theory , which states that all living things are composed of NUM or more cells , the cell is the basic unit of life , and new cells arise from existing cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN later made important contributions to this theory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> our natural world also VERB the principle of form following function , especially in cell biology , and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike prokaryotic cells , eukaryotic cells have : 1 ) a membrane - bound nucleus ; 2 ) numerous membrane - bound organelles such as the NOUN NOUN , PROPN NOUN , NOUN , mitochondria , and others ; and 3 ) several , NOUN - shaped chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because a eukaryotic cell ’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane , it is often said to have a “ true nucleus . ” the word “ NOUN ” means “ little organ , ” and , as already mentioned , organelles have specialized cellular functions , just as the organs of your body have specialized functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at this point , it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear NOUN ( a structure to be discussed ADV ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is made up of organelles VERB in the NOUN - like NOUN , the NOUN , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even though the cytoplasm consists of NUM to NUM percent water , it has a semi - solid NOUN , which comes from the proteins within it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nuclear NOUN is VERB with NOUN that control the passage of ions , molecules , and rna between the ADJ and cytoplasm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN is the semi - solid fluid inside the nucleus , where we find the NOUN and the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some chromosomes have NOUN of dna that VERB PROPN rna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADV ADJ area within the nucleus called the NOUN ( PROPN = PROPN ) VERB the ADJ rna with associated proteins to VERB the ADJ subunits that are then transported out through the NOUN in the nuclear NOUN to the cytoplasm . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are small , round organelles VERB by single membranes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they carry out NOUN reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells : VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are the cell ’s “ NOUN NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> in plant cells , the digestive processes take place in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> enzymes within the ADJ aid the NOUN of proteins , NOUN , lipids , nucleic acids , and even VERB - out organelles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN contain a green NOUN called chlorophyll , which VERB the light energy that VERB the reactions of photosynthesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like plant cells , photosynthetic NOUN also have NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN the NUM types of protein fibers in the NOUN , NOUN are the ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they function in cellular movement , have a diameter of about NUM PROPN , and are made of NUM VERB NOUN of a ADJ protein called NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB your memory , NOUN ( singular = NOUN ) are long , hair - like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell ( for example , sperm , PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when present , the cell has just NUM NOUN or a few NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such transport uses the vascular tissues ( NOUN and phloem ) primarily . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there also exist structural NOUN called PROPN ( singular = PROPN ) , numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells , VERB their cytoplasm , and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell , and thus throughout the plant ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a NOUN between the cell walls of NUM adjacent plant cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of NUM plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gap NOUN in animal cells are like PROPN in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions , nutrients , and other substances that enable cells to communicate ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , however , gap NOUN and PROPN differ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the main NOUN of the membrane is composed of ADJ , NOUN molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ or “ water - VERB ” areas of these molecules ( which look like a collection of NOUN in an NOUN ’s NOUN of the model ) ( [ link ] ) are in contact with the ADJ fluid both inside and outside the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ , or water - VERB molecules , tend to be non - polar . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> integral proteins ( some specialized types are called NOUN ) are , as their name suggests , VERB completely into the membrane structure , and their ADJ membrane - VERB regions interact with the ADJ region of the the NOUN NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> single - pass integral membrane proteins usually have a ADJ NOUN segment that consists of NUM – NUM amino acids . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most direct forms of membrane transport are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to VERB any of its energy to VERB the movement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane ; sometimes the rate of diffusion is VERB by pressure , causing the substances to VERB more rapidly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this occurs in the kidney , where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and VERB VERB substances , or NOUN , out of the blood and into the renal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rate of diffusion in this instance is almost ADV dependent on pressure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> channels are specific for the substance that is being transported . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN proteins have ADJ NOUN exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids ; they additionally have a ADJ NOUN through their core that provides a ADJ opening through the membrane layers ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> passage through the NOUN allows polar compounds to avoid the ADJ central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the movement of water through a ADJ membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane , which is ADV proportional to the concentration of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while diffusion VERB material across membranes and within cells , NOUN VERB only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of NOUN in the water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a solution 's NOUN often directly VERB with the NOUN of the solution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN describes the total NOUN concentration of the solution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a solution with low NOUN has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of NOUN particles ; a solution with high NOUN has fewer water molecules with respect to NOUN particles . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in an ADJ solution , the extracellular fluid has the same NOUN as the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the NOUN of the cell VERB that of the extracellular fluid , there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell , although water will still move in and out . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the electrical gradient of PROPN , a positive ion , also tends to drive it into the cell , but the concentration gradient of PROPN tends to drive PROPN out of the cell ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its ADJ gradient . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on atp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the ADJ gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require atp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN carries NUM specific ion or molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN carries NUM different ions or molecules , both in the same direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN also carries NUM different ions or molecules , but in different directions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is a type of active transport that moves particles , such as large molecules , parts of cells , and even whole cells , into a cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are different variations of NOUN , but all share a common characteristic : the plasma membrane of the cell NOUN , forming a NOUN around the target particle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a variation of PROPN is called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process uses a NOUN protein , called PROPN , on the ADJ side of the plasma membrane , which VERB a similar function to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to VERB material from the cell into the extracellular fluid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> waste material is VERB in a membrane and NOUN with the interior of the plasma membrane . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN require an input of energy to VERB complex molecules from ADJ ones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB sugar from PROPN is NUM example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in most cases , this form is heat energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from NUM system to another that is not doing work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , when an NOUN VERB through the air , some of the energy of the VERB plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if it is released , indeed it would do work . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work , it is called potential energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way : as the NOUN ball VERB ADJ , it has NUM kinetic and NUM percent potential energy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to calculate PROPN , VERB the amount of energy lost to NOUN ( VERB as PROPN ) from the total energy change of the system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this total energy change in the system is called NOUN and is VERB as PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the formula for NOUN PROPN is as follows , where the NOUN t refers to absolute temperature in PROPN ( NOUN PROPN + NUM ) : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these reactions have a net release of energy , but still require some energy in the beginning . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the NOUN energy ( or free energy of NOUN ) and is VERB PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> within the cell , where does energy to power such reactions come from ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the answer VERB with an energy - VERB molecule called NOUN NOUN , or atp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> atp is a small , relatively simple molecule ( [ link ] ) , but within some of its bonds , it contains the potential for a ADJ NOUN of energy that can be VERB to perform cellular work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM reactants might also enter a reaction , both become modified , and leave the reaction as NUM products . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme ’s active site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the active site is where the “ action ” happens , so to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some cases of enzyme NOUN , for example , an NOUN molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when this happens , the enzyme is VERB through competitive NOUN , because an NOUN molecule VERB with the substrate for active site binding ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , in ADJ NOUN , an NOUN molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an ADJ site and still VERB to block substrate binding to the active site . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a most efficient and ADJ way , cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback NOUN of enzyme activity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> feedback NOUN involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell VERB to the NOUN of specific products by VERB down production during ADJ or ADJ reactions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this intermediate complex allows the atp to transfer its third phosphate group , with its energy , to the substrate , a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN refers to the addition of the phosphate ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is illustrated by the following ADJ reaction : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , a process of atp production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate NUM percent of the atp made during glucose NOUN and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to VERB the energy of sunlight . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the production of atp using the process of PROPN is called ADJ NOUN because of the involvement of oxygen in the process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called NOUN proteins , also known as glucose NOUN proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN VERB in the VERB diffusion of glucose . NOUN begins with the NUM carbon ring - shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with NUM molecules of a NUM - carbon sugar called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN consists of NUM distinct phases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there , NOUN will be transformed into an NOUN group that will be VERB up and activated by a carrier compound called NOUN a ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting compound is called PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is made from NOUN NOUN , ADJ acid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) ( [ link ] ) is a series of ADJ ADJ NOUN and NOUN that collectively VERB proteins and VERB lipids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , these NUM functions are performed in separate areas of the PROPN : the ADJ PROPN and the smooth PROPN , respectively . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before reaching their final NOUN , the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be VERB , VERB , and VERB so that they VERB up in the right place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB , NOUN , NOUN , and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the NOUN NOUN ( also called the PROPN body ) , a series of VERB membranes ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the NOUN proteins that transport glucose ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> different forms of the PROPN protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the energy VERB today by the NOUN of NOUN and NOUN products represents sunlight energy VERB and stored by photosynthesis almost NUM NUM years ago . plants , algae , and a group of bacteria called NOUN are the only organisms capable of VERB photosynthesis ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because they use light to VERB their own food , they are called PROPN ( literally , “ self - NOUN using light ” ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed NOUN ( “ other NOUN ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in plants , photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves , which consist of several layers of cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated NOUN called NOUN ( singular : NOUN ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have a double membrane NOUN ( composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> within the NOUN are VERB , NOUN - shaped structures called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> embedded in the NOUN membrane is chlorophyll , a NOUN ( molecule that VERB light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN membrane VERB an internal space called the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] , a NOUN of NOUN is called a NOUN , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the NOUN is called NOUN or “ NOUN ” ( not to be VERB with NOUN or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> art connection <sent_end>
<sent_begin> humans can see only a NOUN of this energy , which portion is therefore referred to as “ visible light . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the manner in which ADJ energy NOUN is described as waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength , the distance between ADJ points of a wave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a single wave is measured from NUM ADJ points , such as from NOUN to NOUN or from NOUN to NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a certain amount of unemployment is a direct result of the relative NOUN of the labor market , considered structural unemployment , which describes when there is a societal level of NOUN between people seeking jobs and the available jobs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN can be geographic ( they are VERB in california , but most ADJ live in PROPN ) , technological ( skilled workers are replaced by NOUN , as in the NOUN industry ) , or can result from any ADJ change in the types of jobs people are seeking versus the types of companies that are VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , PROPN durkheim described what he called “ mechanical ” and “ organic ” NOUN that VERB to a society ’s economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mechanical NOUN exists in ADJ societies where social NOUN comes from VERB similar work , education , and religion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> organic NOUN VERB out of the ADJ NOUN created by the NOUN of work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB this problem , people developed the idea of a means of exchange that could be used at any time : that is , money . <sent_end> <sent_begin> money refers to an object that a society VERB to VERB a value to so it can be VERB for payment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in early economies , money was often objects like NOUN NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , or even NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> scholars do n’t always agree on a single definition of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for our purposes , we will define NOUN as an economic system in which there is private ownership ( as opposed to state ownership ) and where there is an NOUN to produce profit , and ADV wealth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the type of economy in place in the united states today . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by this he meant that if an NOUN did not work to produce or earn the property , then the NOUN was VERB it from those who did . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN believed economies could work using a principle called NOUN , under which individuals and ADJ groups would exchange products with NUM another on the basis of ADV ADJ NOUN ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by far the most important ADJ NOUN on NOUN is PROPN marx . <sent_end> <sent_begin> through his own NOUN and those with his NOUN , NOUN PROPN PROPN , marx used a scientific ADJ process to show that throughout history , the resolution of class NOUN caused changes in economies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN would say to let market forces VERB in a cycle through these stages . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in reality , to control the risk of an economic depression ( a VERB recession across several economic NOUN ) , the u.s. government will often VERB interest rates to encourage more NOUN — and ADV more spending . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in short , VERB the natural cycle VERB is not a ADJ most governments are willing to take . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> factors that define stratification vary in different societies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in most societies , stratification is an economic system , based on wealth , the net value of money and assets a person has , and income , a person ’s wages or investment NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while people are regularly VERB based on how rich or poor they are , other important factors influence social standing . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a class system is based on both social factors and individual NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth , income , education , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike NOUN systems , class systems are open . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is an ideal system based on the belief that social stratification is the result of personal effort — or NOUN — that VERB social standing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high levels of effort will lead to a high social position , and vice ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the last century , the united states has seen a ADJ rise in its standard of living , the level of wealth available to a certain ADJ class in order to VERB the material NOUN and VERB to maintain its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the standard of living is based on factors such as income , employment , class , poverty rates , and housing NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the united states , people who earn a college degree , get a job NOUN , or VERB someone with a good income may move up ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , downward NOUN indicates a NOUN of NUM ’s social class . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some people move downward because of business NOUN , unemployment , or illness . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> patterns of ADJ NOUN can reflect long - term societal changes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , ADJ NOUN refers to changes in a person 's social NOUN over the course of his or her lifetime . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the wealth and NOUN experienced by NUM person may be quite different from that of his or her NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> structural NOUN happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> structural NOUN is ADJ to changes in society as a whole , not individual changes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , sociologists PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN published the PROPN - PROPN NOUN , which argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role , the greater must be the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the theory VERB that social stratification represents the ADV ADJ value of different work . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in fact , a recent PROPN ( NUM ) report that suggested the ADJ NUM - NUM people in the world are worth more than the ADJ NUM NUM combined . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN measures income inequality between countries using a NUM point scale on which NUM represents complete equality and NUM represents the highest possible inequality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the global PROPN NOUN that measured the wealth gap between the core nations in the northern part of the world and the mostly peripheral nations in the southern part of the world was NUM percent ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when this NOUN was developed , ADJ NOUN such as the united states and PROPN were considered part of the first world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ , most ADJ countries were referred to as the third world and included most of ADJ - PROPN africa , latin america , and asia . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as china or PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> those that were in a state of NOUN faced significant NOUN to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> core nations are dominant ADJ countries , highly VERB , technological , and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN VERB that the united states is an economic NOUN that can support or VERB support to important economic legislation with far - reaching NOUN , thus VERB control over every aspect of the global economy and VERB both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN ( organization for economic and PROPN development ) countries make up a group of NUM - NUM nations whose governments work together to promote economic growth and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the world bank ( NUM ) , in NUM , the average ADJ national income ( PROPN ) per capita , or the mean income of the people in a nation , found by VERB total PROPN by the total population , of a high - income nation VERB to the PROPN was $ NUM per capita and the total population was over NUM NUM ( NUM NUM ) ; on average , NUM percent of the population in these nations was urban . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of these countries include the united states , germany , canada , and the united PROPN ( world bank NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high - income countries face NUM major issues : capital flight and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> perhaps the most ADJ issue for middle - income nations is the problem of debt NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the name suggests , debt NOUN is the NOUN of external debt , ADV countries borrow money from other nations to fund their expansion or growth goals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the NOUN of the global economy make VERB these NOUN , or even paying the interest on them , more challenging , nations can find themselves in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ poverty describes poverty that is composed of many NOUN ; it is ADV present when your actual income does not meet your expectations and perceptions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with the concept of ADJ poverty , the poor themselves have a greater say in VERB when it is present . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> child slavery , which may include child NOUN , is a form of NOUN slavery . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in debt NOUN , or VERB labor , the poor VERB themselves as NOUN in exchange for the cost of basic NOUN like transportation , room , and board . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this NOUN , people are paid less than they are charged for room and board . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to PROPN , martin VERB him , and in the VERB NOUN martin was VERB and killed ( PROPN PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a public NOUN followed martin ’s death . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there were NOUN of racial NOUN — the use by law enforcement of race alone to determine whether to stop and VERB someone — a national discussion about “ VERB your ground laws , ” and a VERB NOUN in which PROPN VERB PROPN of VERB an VERB version of the NUM call that made him appear ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN was not arrested until april NUM , when he was charged with second - degree NOUN by special NOUN PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sociologist PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) defined a minority group as “ any group of people who , because of their physical or cultural characteristics , are VERB out from the others in the society in which they live for ADJ and ADJ treatment , and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term minority VERB discrimination , and in its sociological use , the term ADJ group can be used ADV with the term minority , while the term dominant group is often VERB for the group that ’s in the majority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN VERB to the concept that the dominant group is that which holds the most power in a given society , while ADJ groups are those who lack power compared to the dominant group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> prejudice refers to the beliefs , thoughts , feelings , and attitudes someone holds about a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a NOUN , VERB outside actual experience . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , the ADJ number of black men arrested , charged , and VERB of crimes may reflect racial NOUN , a form of institutional racism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is another kind of prejudice , in which someone VERB NUM type of skin tone is ADJ or ADJ to another within a racial group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> studies suggest that ADJ ADJ african americans experience more discrimination than ADJ VERB african americans ( PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN NUM ; PROPN and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> institutional discrimination can also include the NOUN of a group 's status , such in the case of white NOUN , which is the benefits people receive simply by being part of the dominant group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while most white people are willing to VERB that ADJ people live with a set of NOUN due to the color of their skin , very few are willing to VERB the benefits they receive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> racial NOUN in the united states the death of michael brown in ferguson , PROPN on august NUM , NUM illustrates racial NOUN in the united states as well as the NOUN between prejudice , discrimination , and institutional racism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on that day , brown , a young ADJ black man , was killed by a white police NOUN named PROPN wilson . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , PROPN thomas ( NUM ) , the black ADJ NOUN who helped develop the ADJ ADJ technique that VERB the lives of “ blue NOUN ” was classified as a NOUN for many years , and paid as such , despite the fact that he was conducting ADJ ADJ experiments . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the years since the civil war have VERB a pattern of attempted NOUN , with NOUN and voter NOUN efforts VERB at ADV minority NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ sociologist PROPN PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) developed NOUN theory , which suggests we can not separate the effects of race , class , gender , sexual orientation , and other NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when we VERB race and how it can bring us both NOUN and NOUN , it is important to VERB that the way we experience race is shaped , for example , by our gender and class . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN refers to a ADJ group being forced , by a dominant group , to leave a certain area or country . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as seen in the examples of the PROPN of PROPN and the PROPN , NOUN can be a factor in NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN describes the process by which a minority individual or group gives up its own identity by taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , which has a history of VERB and VERB immigrants from different lands , NOUN has been a function of immigration . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , sociologists and most other social scientists view them as ADV distinct . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and NOUN . gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society VERB to being female or male . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN may also be referred to ADV as “ straight ” and “ gay , ” respectively . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the united states is a ADJ society , meaning it VERB sexual orientation is ADV determined and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider that NOUN are often VERB , “ when did you know you were gay ? ” but NOUN are ADV VERB , “ when did you know that you were straight ? ” ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this socialization process , children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term gender role refers to society ’s concept of how men and women are expected to look and how they should behave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these roles are based on norms , or standards , created by society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , it is estimated that NUM to NUM percent of the u.s. population is NOUN ( PROPN law and policy institute NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN individuals who attempt to alter their bodies through medical NOUN such as NOUN and ADJ therapy — so that their physical being is better aligned with gender identity — are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they may also be known as male - to - female ( PROPN ) or female - to - male ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , the word gay ( as it refers to a NOUN ) , carried a somewhat negative and ADJ meaning NUM years ago , but it has since gained more neutral and even positive NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when people perform tasks or possess characteristics based on the gender role VERB to them , they are said to be doing gender . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN is based on the work of west and PROPN ( NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sexual attitudes and PROPN the area of NOUN , sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices , not on NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is viewed as a person ’s capacity for sexual feelings . <sent_end> <sent_begin> studying sexual attitudes and practices is a particularly interesting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a cultural universal . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN research group ( NUM ) VERB there are between NUM and NUM people worldwide who are at least NUM years of age . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are people living to be NUM years old , and they are approximately NUM times more common than NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , there were about NUM NOUN in the united states alone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this ADJ age has been increasing , which indicates the population as a whole is growing older . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a group of people who share a statistical or ADJ trait . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people VERB to the same age NOUN were born in the same time frame . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from NUM to approximately NUM , the global population of individuals age NUM - NUM and older increased by a range of NUM – NUM percent ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this percentage is expected to increase and will have a huge impact on the NOUN ratio : the number of ADJ citizens ( young , ADJ , or elderly ) to productive working citizens ( PROPN and roe NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM country that will soon face a ADJ aging crisis is china , which is on the NOUN of an “ aging NOUN ” — a period when its elderly population will ADV increase . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN and the birth of PROPN <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the early NOUN , a new york NOUN named PROPN PROPN PROPN VERB the term NOUN , a medical NOUN that focuses on the elderly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he created the word by VERB NUM greek words : PROPN ( old man ) and PROPN ( medical treatment ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it VERB new ground and VERB the NOUN for sociologists , social workers , health NOUN , and NOUN to study death and help those who were VERB death . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN - PROPN ’s work is generally considered a major NOUN to NOUN : the systematic study of death and VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the loss of independence is NUM potential part of the process , as are VERB physical ability and age discrimination . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term NOUN refers to the aging process , including biological , emotional , intellectual , social , and ADJ changes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this section VERB some of the challenges we VERB during this process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this makes the care - providing situation more complex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ abuse occurs when a NOUN ADV VERB an older person of care or VERB the person in his or her charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN may be family members , NOUN , NOUN , health NOUN , or employees of senior housing or NOUN care . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to NOUN theory , the elderly make specific choices to maintain NOUN in internal ( personality structure , beliefs ) and external structures ( relationships ) , remaining active and involved throughout their NOUN years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is an attempt to maintain social equilibrium and stability by making future decisions on the basis of already developed social roles ( PROPN NUM ; PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , exchange theory ( PROPN NUM ) , a rational choice approach , suggests we experience an increased NOUN as we age and must increasingly VERB to the will of others because we have fewer ways of VERB others to VERB to us . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , ADP as relationships are based on ADJ NOUN , as the elderly become less able to exchange resources , they will see their social NOUN VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in many cultures , newly married couples move in with , or near to , family members . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a ADJ NOUN system it is ADJ for the NOUN to live with ( or near ) her NOUN ’s blood NOUN ( or family or orientation ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ systems can be VERB back thousands of years . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is often characterized as violence between household or family members , specifically NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to include ADJ , VERB , and same - sex couples , family sociologists have created the term ADJ NOUN violence ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> women are the primary NOUN of ADJ NOUN violence . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NOUN , and the differences in the way societies and individuals experience religion , provide rich material for sociological study . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in studying religion , sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience , beliefs , and NOUN of a religion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> religious experience refers to the NOUN or NOUN that we are connected to “ the PROPN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of NOUN might be experienced when people are VERB or VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular NOUN hold to be true , such as that PROPN PROPN was the NOUN of god , or that NOUN exists . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , PROPN began as a NOUN , transformed into a NOUN , and today exists as an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , like NOUN , are new religious groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states today this term often carries ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for instance , the christian NOUN of the PROPN PROPN ( god , PROPN , PROPN PROPN ) VERB the definition of NOUN , which is a religion based on belief in a single NOUN , to some scholars . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , many PROPN view the multiple NOUN of PROPN ’s NOUN as ADJ , which is a religion based on belief in multiple NOUN , , while PROPN might describe those NOUN are a ADJ parallel to the christian PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some japanese practice PROPN , which follows NOUN , which is a religion that VERB in the NOUN of ADJ NOUN , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice NOUN believe in a ADJ connection between humans and other natural NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN began as a movement within the PROPN PROPN church in the 1950s and 1960s in latin america , and it VERB christian principles with political NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it uses the church to promote social change via the political NOUN , and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or VERB social NOUN , discrimination , and poverty . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> formal education describes the learning of ADJ facts and concepts through a formal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB from the NOUN of ADJ greek NOUN , centuries of scholars have VERB topics through VERB methods of learning . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another global concern in education is universal access . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this term refers to people ’s equal ability to participate in an education system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such a situation leads to social class reproduction , ADV studied by french sociologist PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he VERB how cultural capital , or cultural knowledge that serves ( ADV ) as currency that helps us VERB a culture , VERB the experiences and opportunities available to french students from different social classes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> members of the upper and middle classes have more cultural capital than do families of lower - class status . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , the bush administration passed the no child left behind act , which requires states to test students in VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the results of those tests determine NOUN to receive federal funding . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to PROPN , the power of traditional authority is accepted because that has traditionally been the case ; its NOUN exists because it has been accepted for a long time . <sent_end> <sent_begin> britain ’s PROPN elizabeth , for instance , VERB a position that she inherited based on the traditional rules of NOUN for the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> according to PROPN , power made ADJ by laws , written rules , and regulations is termed rational - legal authority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this type of authority , power is VERB in a particular NOUN , system , or NOUN and not necessarily in the person who VERB the NOUN of that doctrine . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as mentioned above , the NOUN of most modern nations are ADJ NOUN of NOUN , and individuals who hold NOUN in such NOUN are often ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a few nations today , however , are run by governments ADV a NOUN has absolute or ADJ power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such nations are called absolute NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although governments and NOUN are ADV changing across the global NOUN , it is generally safe to say that most modern absolute NOUN are concentrated in the middle east and africa . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> power in a NOUN is held by a single person ( or a very small group ) that VERB complete and absolute authority over a government and population . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like some absolute NOUN , NOUN may be ADJ and seek to limit or even VERB the liberties of the general population . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , the united states is a constitution - based federal republic in which citizens elect representatives to make policy decisions on their behalf . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term representative democracy , which is ADV ADJ with republic , can also be used to describe a government in which citizens elect representatives to promote policies that favor their interests . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , representatives are elected at local and state levels , and the votes of the electoral college determine who will hold the office of president . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> marx believed that conflict between groups VERB to either VERB wealth and power or keep the wealth and power they had was ADJ in a ADJ society , and conflict was the only way for the ADJ to eventually gain some measure of equality . <sent_end> <sent_begin> c . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) VERB on some of marx ’s concepts , VERB the NOUN power elite to describe what he saw as the small group of powerful people who control much of a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN believed the power elite use government to develop social policies that allow them to keep their wealth . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys ; NUM gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the pancreas , illustrated in [ link ] , is an ADJ organ that is located between the stomach and the ADJ portion of the small intestine . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains both ADJ cells that VERB digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the heart VERB endocrine cells in the walls of the NOUN that are specialized ADJ muscle cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these cells release the hormone ADJ ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) in response to increased blood volume . <sent_end> <sent_begin> high blood volume causes the cells to be VERB , resulting in hormone release . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN has been used by NOUN to improve performance , as greater oxygen NOUN to muscle cells allows for greater NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because red blood cells increase the NOUN of blood , ADV high levels of PROPN can cause severe health NOUN . the NOUN is found behind the NOUN ; it is most prominent in NOUN , becoming smaller in size through NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN produces hormones referred to as PROPN , which contribute to the development of the immune response . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) , which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ action of PROPN is to regulate the amount of water VERB by the kidneys . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast to PROPN , which VERB the NOUN of water to maintain proper water balance , NOUN VERB proper water balance by VERB NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the NOUN of NOUN PROPN and PROPN , NOUN is referred to as a NOUN , a NOUN that affects ion and water balance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels , blood volume , or blood pressure , or an increase in blood NOUN levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during NOUN in both males and females , the hypothalamus produces NOUN - releasing hormone ( PROPN ) , which stimulates the production and release of NOUN - stimulating hormone ( PROPN ) and ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) from the anterior pituitary gland . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these hormones regulate the NOUN ( NOUN in males and NOUN in females ) and therefore are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in both males and females , PROPN stimulates NOUN production and PROPN stimulates production of hormones by the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN stimulates the production of NOUN by the ADJ glands following NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN levels are regulated by the ADJ hormones NOUN - releasing hormone ( NOUN ) and NOUN - VERB hormone ( PROPN ) , which is now known to be NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN stimulates the release of NOUN and PROPN VERB it . the posterior pituitary releases the hormone NOUN , which stimulates ADJ NOUN during NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ insulin function can lead to a condition called NOUN NOUN , the main symptoms of which are illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the ADJ cells of the pancreas , or by reduced NOUN of tissue cells to insulin . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the basal metabolic rate , which is the amount of NOUN required by the body at rest , is determined by NUM hormones produced by the thyroid gland : NOUN , also known as PROPN or PROPN , and PROPN , also known as PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain , NOUN , NOUN , blood cells , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN NOUN , which occurs in many developing countries , results in an inability to VERB PROPN and PROPN hormones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the thyroid gland VERB in a condition called NOUN , which is caused by NOUN of PROPN without the formation of thyroid hormone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is VERB in a fluid called NOUN , and NOUN NOUN results in higher levels of NOUN NOUN in the thyroid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> blood calcium levels are regulated by ADJ hormone ( PROPN ) , which is produced by the ADJ glands , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is released in response to low blood NOUN + levels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this results in a NOUN by most tissues from VERB glucose as an energy source to VERB fatty acids . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is called a glucose - VERB effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in another direct mechanism , PROPN stimulates NOUN NOUN in the liver ; the NOUN is then released into the blood as glucose . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a ADJ production of growth hormone is critical for proper development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of PROPN in adults does not appear to cause any NOUN , but in children it can result in pituitary NOUN , in which growth is reduced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> pituitary NOUN is characterized by ADJ body formation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the sympathetic nervous system VERB the stress response via the hypothalamus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which VERB short - term stress responses ) via nerve NOUN , and the adrenal cortex , which VERB long - term stress responses , via the hormone PROPN hormone ( PROPN ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . short - term stress PROPN presented with a stressful situation , the body VERB by VERB for the release of hormones that provide a NOUN of energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hormones NOUN ( also known as NOUN ) and NOUN ( also known as NOUN ) are released by the adrenal medulla . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they change enzyme NOUN in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM main NOUN : NOUN such as NOUN , and PROPN such as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these hormones target the NOUN of fat into fatty acids in the ADJ tissue . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this can cause the NOUN of ADJ tissue in the face and NOUN , and excessive glucose in the blood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN of the NOUN can cause PROPN ’s disease , which may result in NOUN of the skin , NOUN , and low NOUN levels in the blood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the skull consists of NUM bones , which are divided into NUM categories : ADJ bones and facial bones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the auditory NOUN consist of NUM bones each : the PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are the ADJ bones in the body and are unique to mammals . NUM facial bones form the face , provide NOUN for the sense organs ( eyes , mouth , and NOUN ) , protect the NOUN to the digestive and ADJ NOUN , and serve as attachment points for facial muscles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM facial bones are the ADJ bones , the ADJ bones , ADJ bones , PROPN , PROPN , ADJ bones , the ADJ NOUN NOUN , and the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN composed of ADJ NOUN NOUN between adjacent ADJ bodies from the second ADJ NOUN to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the NOUN and acts as a NOUN to absorb NOUN from movements such as VERB and running . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is formed from NUM bones that fuse in the adult . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are NUM pairs of long , ADJ bones that VERB to the ADJ NOUN and curve toward the front of the body , forming the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN VERB the anterior ends of the NOUN to the NOUN , with the exception of NOUN pairs NUM and NUM , which are free - VERB NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the magnitude of the NOUN is called the NOUN moment . these NUM centers of charge will VERB some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge , as on a dna molecule . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this results in a reduction in the strength of the PROPN interaction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> one might say that NOUN makes the PROPN force a short range force rather than long range . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a conductor placed in an electric field will be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows the result of VERB a neutral conductor in an originally ADJ electric field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the familiar term voltage is the common name for potential difference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> keep in mind that ADV a voltage is VERB , it is understood to be the potential difference between NUM points . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> van de PROPN NOUN ( or van de PROPN ) are not only ADJ NOUN used to demonstrate high voltage due to ADJ NOUN — they are also used for ADJ research . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first was built by robert van de PROPN in NUM ( based on original NOUN by PROPN PROPN ) for use in nuclear physics research . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> large ADJ NOUN are used ADV to remove over NUM % of the particles from ADJ gas NOUN associated with the NOUN of NOUN and oil . <sent_end> <sent_begin> home NOUN , often in NOUN with the home NOUN and air conditioning system , are very effective in VERB VERB particles , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the more easily it is VERB , the greater its NOUN constant NOUN NOUN size NUM { k } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> water , for example , is a polar molecule because NUM end of the molecule has a ADJ positive charge and the other end has a ADJ negative charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of water causes it to have a relatively large NOUN constant of NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> { } [ link ] shows the NOUN for a simple circuit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a simple circuit has a single voltage source and a single NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the voltage source to the NOUN can be VERB to have ADJ resistance , or their resistance can be included in NOUN size NUM { r } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows a NOUN of a simple circuit with an PROPN voltage source . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the voltage between the NOUN VERB as shown , with the PROPN voltage given by <sent_end>
<sent_begin> electric power causes ADJ NOUN effects ADV electric energy is converted to thermal energy at a rate ADV than it can be ADV VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ example of this is the short circuit , a low - resistance path between NOUN of a voltage source . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of a short circuit is shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nerve NOUN is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is NUM aspect of NOUN , or electrical effects in and created by biological systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most NOUN have more than NUM component , called a NOUN that limits the flow of charge in the circuit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a measure of this limit on charge flow is called resistance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when are NOUN in series ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are in series ADV the flow of charge , called the current , must flow through NOUN ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if current flows through a person holding a NOUN and into the earth , then PROPN PROPN size NUM { r rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } in [ link ] ( a ) could be the resistance of the NOUN ’s NOUN , PROPN PROPN size NUM { r rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } the resistance of its NOUN , PROPN PROPN size NUM { r rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } the person ’s body resistance , and PROPN PROPN size NUM { r rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } the resistance of her shoes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows NOUN in series connected to a voltage source . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the loop rule is stated in terms of potential , v v size NUM { v } { } , rather than potential energy , but the NUM are related since PROPN NOUN = q NOUN NOUN = q NUM size NUM { ital " PROPN " rsub { size NUM { " NOUN " } } = ital " PUNCT " } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recall that emf is the potential difference of a source when no current is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a closed loop , DET energy is supplied by emf must be transferred into other forms by NOUN in the loop , since there are no other ways in which energy can be transferred into or out of the circuit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ) the NUM crucial characteristics of a given NOUN are its resistance and current NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> current NOUN is the current that gives a full - scale NOUN of the NOUN ’s NOUN , the maximum current that the NOUN can measure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , a NOUN with a current NOUN of NUM NOUN PROPN has a maximum NOUN of its NOUN when NUM PROPN NUM PROPN flows through it , VERB half - scale when NUM NUM NUM PROPN size NUM { NUM NUM NUM " NUM } { } flows through it , and so on . if such a NOUN has a NUM size NUM " % NOUN } { } resistance , then a voltage of only v = PROPN = NUM NUM NUM NOUN = NUM NOUN = PROPN = NUM NUM NUM NOUN = NUM NOUN size NUM { v = ital " PROPN " = left ( " NUM " PROPN right ) left ( " NUM " % NOUN right ) = NUM " .

<sent_begin> only certain materials , such as NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN , exhibit strong magnetic effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such materials are called ADJ , after the latin word for NOUN , PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a group of materials made from the NOUN of the rare earth elements are also used as strong and permanent NOUN ; a popular one is NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> increased thermal motion at higher temperature can VERB and VERB the orientation and the size of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a well - defined temperature for ADJ materials , which is called the PROPN temperature , above which they can not be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN temperature for NOUN is NUM k ( NUM NOUN c ) ( NUM NOUN c ) size NUM { NOUN ( " PROPN NOUN c NOUN ) } { } , which is well above room temperature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a current loop always produces a magnetic NOUN — that is , a magnetic field that acts like a north pole and south pole pair . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since VERB north and south magnetic NOUN , called magnetic NOUN , are not observed , NOUN are used to explain all magnetic effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if magnetic NOUN did exist , then we would have to VERB this underlying connection that all NOUN is due to electrical current . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in VERB the strength and direction of the magnetic field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] , the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a NOUN NOUN points . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the magnetic field is traditionally called the b - field . magnetic field lines are defined to have the direction that a small NOUN points when placed at a location . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are the most common application of magnetic force on current - carrying NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN have NOUN of NOUN in a magnetic field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the magnetic field strength ( magnitude ) produced by a long straight current - carrying NOUN is found by experiment to be <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this results in a more complete law , called PROPN ’s law , which VERB magnetic field and current in a general way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s law in turn is a part of PROPN ’s NOUN , which give a complete theory of all electromagnetic phenomena . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of how PROPN ’s NOUN appear to different NOUN led to the modern theory of relativity , and the NOUN that electric and magnetic fields are different NOUN of the same NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> only near the ends does it begin to VERB and change direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the field outside has similar NOUN to flat NOUN and bar NOUN , but the magnetic field strength inside a NOUN is simply <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these can be measured but with some difficulty since their NOUN are about NUM NOUN NUM NOUN NUM size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { - NUM } } } { } to NUM NOUN NUM NOUN NUM size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { - NUM } } } { } less than the earth ’s magnetic field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB of the heart ’s magnetic field as it VERB is called a PROPN ( PROPN ) , while measurements of the brain ’s magnetic field is called a PROPN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both give information that VERB from that obtained by measuring the electric fields of these organs ( NOUN and NOUN ) , but they are not yet of sufficient importance to make these difficult measurements common . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the minus means that the emf creates a current i and magnetic field b that VERB the change in NOUN PROPN PROPN size NUM { PROPN } { } — this is known as PROPN ’s law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the direction ( given by the minus sign ) of the NOUN so important that it is called PROPN ’s law after the ADJ PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , who , like PROPN and henry , ADV VERB aspects of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN was aware of the direction , but PROPN stated it so clearly that he is VERB for its discovery . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if PROPN emf can cause a current loop in the conductor , we refer to that current as an NOUN current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN can produce significant NOUN , called magnetic NOUN , on the motion involved . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider the NOUN shown in [ link ] , which VERB a NOUN PROPN between the NOUN of a strong NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is , when a motor is doing work and its NOUN is VERB , an emf is generated . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s law VERB us the emf VERB any change , so that the input emf that powers the motor will be opposed by the motor ’s self - generated emf , called the back emf of the motor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN even provide a variable output by allowing connection to be made at different points on the secondary NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a step - up NOUN is one that increases voltage , whereas a step - down NOUN decreases voltage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB , as we have , that resistance is ADJ , the electrical power output of a NOUN VERB its input . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is not how power is VERB in practice . <sent_end> <sent_begin> modern household and industrial NOUN requires the NUM - NOUN system , shown ADV in [ link ] , which has several safety features . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first is the familiar circuit NOUN ( or fuse ) to prevent thermal NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> self - ADV , the effect of PROPN ’s law of NOUN of a device on itself , also exists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when , for example , current through a NOUN is increased , the magnetic field and NOUN also increase , VERB a NOUN emf , as required by PROPN ’s law . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many people VERB sound waves with radio waves , NUM type of electromagnetic ( PROPN ) wave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , sound and radio waves are completely different phenomena . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> magnetic field lines are continuous , having no beginning or end . <sent_end> <sent_begin> no magnetic NOUN are known to exist . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the electric and magnetic fields produced by a long straight NOUN NOUN are exactly in phase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that they are ADJ to NUM another and to the direction of NOUN , making this a ADJ wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the broad category of radio waves is defined to contain any electromagnetic wave produced by NOUN in NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its name VERB from their most common use as a carrier of ADJ information ( i.e. , radio ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> a carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio NOUN , say NUM NOUN , is ADJ or VERB in amplitude by an ADJ signal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting wave has a constant frequency , but a varying amplitude . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( the entire PROPN radio NOUN VERB between channels NUM NOUN and NUM NOUN . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN channels are called PROPN ( for very high frequency ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other channels called PROPN ( for ADJ high frequency ) VERB an even higher frequency range of NUM to NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> since they have high frequencies , their NOUN are short compared with those of other radio waves — hence the name “ NOUN . ” NOUN can also be produced by atoms and molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are , for example , a component of electromagnetic radiation generated by thermal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the thermal motion of atoms and molecules in any object at a temperature above absolute NUM causes them to VERB and absorb radiation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> visible light is the ADJ segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the normal human eye VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> visible light is produced by NOUN and NOUN of atoms and molecules , as well as by ADJ NOUN within atoms and molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> anyone who has used a NOUN NOUN VERB there is energy in electromagnetic waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes this energy is obvious , such as in the NOUN of the NOUN sun . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> light may change direction when it VERB objects ( such as a NOUN ) or in passing from NUM material to another ( such as in passing from air to glass ) , but it then continues in a straight line or as a ray . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the word ray comes from NOUN and here means a straight line that VERB at some point . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is acceptable to VERB light rays as NOUN rays ( or even science NOUN NOUN of ray NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ray <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , it is used to VERB NOUN , internet , and NOUN NOUN signals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN VERB the transmission of light down fibers of NOUN or glass . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the fibers are thin , light entering NUM is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and , thus , be ADV VERB ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what this implies is that white light is spread out according to wavelength in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is defined as the NOUN of white light into its full spectrum of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more ADV , NOUN occurs ADV there is a process that changes the direction of light in a manner that depends on wavelength . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows a ADJ lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis ( the path taken by ray NUM in the figure is the axis of the lens ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ lens is a VERB lens , because it causes the light rays to VERB away ( VERB ) from its axis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , the lens has been shaped so that all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to VERB from the same point , PROPN size NUM { f } { } , defined to be the ADJ point of a VERB lens . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the image formed in [ link ] is a real image , meaning that it can be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , light rays from NUM point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be VERB onto a NOUN , a piece of NOUN , or the retina of an eye , for example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when an NOUN VERB NOUN as a problem in ADJ people , it is most likely due to NOUN of the lens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the lens of the eye changes with age in ways that tend to preserve the ability to see ADJ objects clearly but do not allow the eye to VERB for close vision , a condition called NOUN ( literally , ADJ eye ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to correct this vision NOUN , we place a VERB , positive power lens in front of the eye , such as found in reading NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the distance to the ADJ object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye ( normally NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , or NOUN , is the inability to see close objects clearly while ADJ objects may be clear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ eye does not VERB sufficient rays from a close object to make the rays meet on the retina . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN vision NOUN has VERB rapidly in the last few years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is the ADJ and by far the most successful in a series of NOUN that correct vision by VERB the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM types of cones , and each type is sensitive to different NOUN of NOUN , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a VERB theory of color vision is that there are NUM primary NOUN VERB to the NUM types of cones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the thousands of other NOUN that we can distinguish among are created by various NOUN of NOUN of the NUM types of cones . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each NOUN forms an image that is compared with the others , and the eye - brain system thus can compare a NOUN - VERB white NOUN NOUN with its generally ADJ NOUN and determine that it is actually white . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN theory of color vision is an example of modified theories of color vision that attempt to account for its NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM ADJ experiment performed by land VERB that some type of image NOUN may produce color vision . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the initial stage of the project is the construction of the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN in western PROPN ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the project will use VERB - NOUN NOUN such as adaptive NOUN in which the lens or NOUN is VERB from NOUN of ADV aligned ADJ NOUN and NOUN that can be VERB using NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a range of rapidly changing NOUN can be VERB by VERB or VERB the ADJ NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> furthermore , young first passed light from a single source ( the sun ) through a single NOUN to make the light somewhat ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by ADJ , we mean waves are in phase or have a ADJ phase relationship . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ means the waves have random phase relationships . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are specific directions for the NOUN of the electric and magnetic fields . <sent_end> <sent_begin> polarization is the NOUN that a wave ’s NOUN have a ADJ direction relative to the direction of NOUN of the wave . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( this is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to VERB this further , consider the ADJ waves in the NOUN shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN in NUM NOUN are in a vertical plane and are said to be ADV VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those in the other NOUN are in a horizontal plane and are ADV VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> einstein essentially did the ADJ aspect of this method for relativity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> with NUM ADV simple NOUN and a ADJ NOUN of how measurements are made , he produced the theory of special relativity . einstein ’s first PROPN <sent_end>
<sent_begin> not only are laws of physics ADJ in ADJ NOUN , but they should be the same in all ADJ NOUN , since there is no ADJ frame and no absolute motion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> einstein VERB these ideas into his first NOUN of special relativity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first PROPN of special relativity <sent_end>
<sent_begin> time NOUN is the phenomenon of time passing ADV for an NOUN who is moving relative to another NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just as with classical physics , quantum physics has several NOUN , such as NOUN and the study of electromagnetic forces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN principle states that in the classical limit ( large , slow - moving objects ) , quantum NOUN becomes the same as classical physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this chapter , we begin the development of quantum NOUN and its NOUN of the ADJ ADJ world . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when light VERB materials , it can VERB electrons from them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called the ADJ effect , meaning that light ( NOUN ) produces NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM common use of the ADJ effect is in light NOUN , such as those that VERB the automatic NOUN on various types of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a curve like this is obtained by VERB many NOUN , and it is ADJ that the maximum energy is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB process produces radiation that is called PROPN ( german for VERB radiation ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second feature is the existence of ADJ NOUN in the spectrum ; these are called characteristic x rays , since they are characteristic of the NOUN material . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the range of photon NOUN for visible light from red to NOUN is NUM to NUM NOUN , respectively ( left for this chapter ’s problems and NOUN to VERB ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are on the order of those between outer electron NOUN in atoms and molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the quantum of PROPN radiation we call a photon has properties ADJ to those of particles we can see , such as NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a photon VERB as a unit in NOUN or when absorbed , rather than as an extensive wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> after VERB enough data , you get a distribution related to the particle ’s wavelength and NOUN pattern . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is a certain probability of finding the particle at a given location , and the overall pattern is called a probability distribution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> those who developed quantum NOUN VERB NOUN that VERB the probability distribution in various circumstances . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another is what PROPN in particular believed — that there is a ADJ unit that can not be further VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN called this the atom . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we now know that atoms themselves can be VERB , but their identity is VERB in the process , so the PROPN were correct in a respect . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> based on the size and mass of the nucleus VERB by his experiment , as well as the mass of electrons , PROPN proposed the ADJ model of the atom . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ model of the atom NOUN low - mass electrons VERB a large - mass nucleus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> double - NOUN interference ( wave PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to obtain ADJ interference for a double NOUN , the path length difference from NUM NOUN must be an integral multiple of the wavelength . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> here , X X size NUM { e rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } is the ground - state energy n = NUM n = NUM size NUM { left ( n = NUM right ) } { } for hydrogen z = NUM z = NUM size NUM { left ( z = NUM right ) } { } and is given by NOUN = NUM NUM NUM PROPN NUM PROPN k NUM h NUM = NUM e v . <sent_end> <sent_begin> e NUM = NUM NUM NUM q e NUM m e k NUM h NUM = NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , for hydrogen , <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , typical x - ray NOUN act like rays when they VERB ADJ objects , like teeth , and produce ADJ NOUN ; however , since atoms are on the order of NUM NOUN in size , x rays can be used to detect the location , shape , and size of atoms and molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process is called x - ray NOUN , because it involves the NOUN and interference of x rays to produce patterns that can be VERB for information about the structures that VERB the x rays . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perhaps the most famous example of x - ray NOUN is the discovery of the double - helix structure of dna in NUM by an international NOUN of scientists working at the PROPN PROPN — american james PROPN , PROPN PROPN PROPN , and new PROPN – born PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some of these may be in the visible range , such as for the NOUN in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is defined to be any process in which an atom or molecule , excited by a photon of a given energy , and de - NOUN by emission of a lower - energy photon . NOUN can be induced by many types of energy input . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN , NOUN , and even NOUN NOUN in NOUN make NOUN seem ADJ in sunlight by VERB some NOUN into visible light . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this includes those electrons originally excited to the ADJ state and those that VERB into it from above . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is possible to get a majority of the atoms into the ADJ state , a condition called a population NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) energy - level diagram for an atom showing the first few states , NUM of which is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( b ) massive energy input VERB atoms to a variety of states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the name NOUN means “ entire picture ” ( from the greek NOUN , as in ADJ ) , because the image is NUM - dimensional . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the process of producing NOUN and , although they are VERB on ADJ NOUN , the process is quite different from normal NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the new NOUN is that the direction of the ADJ ADJ momentum is also VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fact that the ADJ ADJ momentum can have only certain directions is called space NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like many aspects of quantum NOUN , this NOUN of direction is ADV ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> that is , no NUM electrons can be in the same state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this statement is known as the PROPN NOUN principle , because it VERB electrons from being in the same state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN NOUN principle is extremely powerful and very ADV ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the rays themselves are called nuclear radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a nucleus that ADV VERB part of its mass to VERB radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a substance or object that VERB nuclear radiation is said to be ADJ . NUM types of experimental evidence VERB that PROPN ’s rays VERB deep in the heart ( or nucleus ) of an atom . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the range of radiation is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material . <sent_end> <sent_begin> range is related to several factors , including the energy of the radiation , the material VERB , and the type of radiation ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN are used in a variety of research and diagnostic NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> among these are the NOUN by NOUN - VERB equipment of the radiation from ADJ NOUN , the analysis of radiation from a person VERB body NOUN , and the NOUN of ADJ particles in NOUN NOUN . light from a NOUN is converted into electrical signals by NOUN such as the NOUN tube shown ADV in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these tubes are based on the ADJ effect , which is VERB in stages into a NOUN of electrons , hence the name NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , there are actually NUM types of particles in the nuclei — the NOUN and the NOUN , referred to collectively as NOUN , the constituents of nuclei . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as its name implies , the NOUN is a neutral particle ( q = NUM q = NUM size NUM { q = NUM } { } ) that has nearly the same mass and ADJ NOUN as the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> nuclear decay has provided an ADJ NOUN into the realm of the very small . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nuclear decay gave the first NOUN of the connection between mass and energy , and it VERB the existence of NUM of the NUM basic forces in nature . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN in β NOUN β NOUN size NUM { β rsup { size NUM { - { } } } } { } decay is an electron ’s NOUN , given the NOUN PUNCT PUNCT , where NOUN is the greek NOUN PROPN , and the NOUN e means this NOUN is related to the electron . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bar indicates this is a particle of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( all particles have NOUN NOUN that are nearly identical except that they have the opposite charge . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> electron capture is the third type of NOUN decay . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here , a nucleus VERB an inner - shell electron and VERB a nuclear reaction that has the same effect as PROPN PROPN size NUM { β rsup { size NUM { + { } } } } { } decay . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for an ADJ time , not just a multiple of the half - life , the ADJ relationship must be used . ADJ NOUN is a ADJ use of naturally occurring NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its most famous application is NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN has a half - life of NUM years and is produced in a nuclear reaction induced when ADJ NOUN strike NUM NUM size NUM { " " PROPN { size NUM { " NUM " } } NUM } { } in the atmosphere . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the probability of finding a particle is related to the NOUN of its wave function , and so there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier , which implies that the particle can VERB through the barrier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is called barrier NOUN or quantum mechanical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this concept was developed in theory by PROPN robert PROPN ( who led the development of the first nuclear NOUN during world war ii ) and was used by PROPN and others to describe α α size NUM { α } { } decay . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the compound is said to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ compound used for medical purposes is called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> radiation NOUN external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a NOUN to VERB ADV useful information . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these PROPN rays have identical NUM - NOUN v NOUN ( the energy comes from the NOUN of an electron or NOUN mass ) and they move directly away from NUM another , allowing NOUN to determine their point of origin ADV , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the system is called NOUN emission NOUN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it requires NOUN on opposite sides to simultaneously ( i.e. , at the same time ) detect NOUN of NUM - NOUN v energy and VERB computer NOUN techniques similar to those in PROPN and PROPN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> under this assumption , any NOUN of radiation , no matter how small , involves a risk to human health . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called the linear hypothesis and it may be ADJ , but it is controversial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is some evidence that , unlike the immediate effects of radiation , the long - term effects are ADJ and there is little self - NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN of VERB radiation , called radiation therapy or NOUN , have existed since the discovery of x - rays and nuclear NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> today , NOUN is used almost ADV for cancer therapy , where it VERB thousands of lives and VERB the quality of life and NOUN of many it can not save . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how does food NOUN work ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN produces a random NOUN of broken molecules and ions , some with ADJ NOUN or hydrogen - containing molecules known as free NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these undergo rapid chemical reactions , producing perhaps NUM or NUM NUM different compounds called ADJ products , some of which make cell function impossible by VERB cell membranes , VERB dna , and so on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these NUM factors — temperature , density , and time — VERB NUM another , and so a NOUN in one can be VERB for by the others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is defined to occur when the reactions produce enough energy to be self - VERB after external energy input is cut off . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this goal , which must be reached before commercial plants can be a reality , has not been achieved . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> huge power input VERB the NOUN , VERB the VERB NOUN and VERB the NOUN to high density with the expanding ADJ plasma produced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this technique is called ADJ NOUN , because the NOUN ’s NOUN VERB it from VERB before significant fusion can take place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> higher NOUN have been reached than with NOUN , but with smaller NOUN times . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN NOUN between the NUM ends then VERB in VERB the nucleus , which VERB like a water VERB into NUM large NOUN and a few neutrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - induced NOUN can be written as <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to produce large power , NOUN contain NOUN to thousands of critical NOUN , and the chain reaction easily becomes self - VERB , a condition called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN should be ADV regulated to avoid an ADJ increase in NOUN , a condition called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> control NOUN help prevent VERB , perhaps even a NOUN or ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN VERB the flower to the plant . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN of NOUN ( collectively called the PROPN ) is located at the base of the NOUN and VERB the ADJ ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are usually photosynthetic organs , although there are some NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ houses NUM or more NOUN , each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization . the male reproductive organs , the NOUN ( collectively called the NOUN ) , VERB the central NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are composed of a thin NOUN called a NOUN and a sac - like structure called the NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN include NOUN and NOUN , and NOUN or NOUN form a ADJ group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> basal NOUN are a group of plants that are believed to have VERB off before the separation into NOUN and NOUN because they exhibit traits from both groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are VERB ADV in many NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> explore this NOUN for additional information on NOUN . more than NUM percent of NOUN VERB on animals for pollination : the transfer of pollen from the NOUN to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADV , plants have developed many NOUN to attract NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> efforts to preserve NOUN take several lines of action , from VERB ADJ seeds to NOUN species . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ seeds come from plants that were traditionally VERB in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a technique in which NUM or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through dna analysis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first ADJ record of NOUN VERB their appearance to the ADJ period , about NUM NUM years ago ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN were VERB by PROPN , the first ADJ seed plants , which VERB about NUM NUM years ago . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN were a ADJ group of plants that ADV VERB NOUN ( NOUN NOUN ) because they produced NOUN from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues ; however , they still VERB like ferns , releasing spores into the environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> seed ferns ( [ link ] ) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called NOUN to VERB and protect the NOUN — the female gametophyte and associated tissues — which develops into a seed upon fertilization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> seed plants VERB modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the NOUN NOUN of the PROPN period . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM cell NOUN VERB the single - ADJ zygote into an NUM - ADJ structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after further cell division and NOUN of existing cells , a NUM ADJ structure called a NOUN is formed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> next , the NOUN VERB further cell division and cellular NOUN during a process called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> different cell layers ( called NOUN layers ) are formed during NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN layers are VERB to develop into certain tissue types , organs , and organ systems during a process called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> further NOUN of animals with NUM NOUN layers ( NOUN ) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from NOUN , called a NOUN , and those that do not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ cell - VERB PROPN cavity represents a space , usually filled with fluid , which VERB between the ADJ organs and the body wall . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a third group of NOUN has a slightly different NOUN derived ADV from NOUN and ADV from NOUN , which is found between the NUM layers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although still functional , these are considered false NOUN , and those animals are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the phylum PROPN ( NOUN ) is an example of a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the mouth or NOUN develops from a structure called the PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is the NOUN formed during the initial stages of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in later stages , a second opening forms , and these NUM NOUN will eventually give rise to the mouth and NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ distinction between NOUN and NOUN is the type of NOUN VERB by the zygote . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN undergo ADJ NOUN , meaning that the cells of NUM pole of the embryo are VERB , and thus VERB , with respect to the cells of the opposite pole . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is due to the ADJ angle of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , NOUN undergo ADJ NOUN , in which cells are not yet pre - determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these cells are referred to as ADJ cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN includes NOUN and NOUN ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : ADJ NOUN ( termed NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is named for NUM structural features , each common to certain NOUN within the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some NOUN NOUN are characterized by a ADJ stage called NOUN NOUN , and other NOUN are characterized by the presence of a NOUN structure called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN PROPN of animal PROPN PROPN period , occurring between approximately NUM – NUM NUM years ago , VERB the most rapid evolution of new animal NOUN and animal diversity in earth ’s history . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is believed that most of the animal NOUN in existence today had their NOUN during this time , often referred to as the PROPN NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN VERB during this period . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN , or PROPN , are animals that do not contain bony structures , such as the NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ of all the NOUN are the PROPN , which include only the phylum PROPN : the sponges ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ( “ ADP animals ” ) do not display tissue - level organization , although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while sponges ( VERB the NOUN ) do not exhibit tissue - layer organization , they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , which are ADJ - like cells , form the outermost layer of sponges and VERB a NOUN - like substance called X . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is an extracellular matrix consisting of a NOUN - like NOUN with VERB cells that perform various functions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some sponges , PROPN are formed by NOUN , single tube - shaped cells that act as NOUN to regulate the flow of water into the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in other sponges , PROPN are formed by NOUN in the body wall of the NOUN . PROPN ( “ NOUN cells ” ) are present at various NOUN , depending on the type of NOUN , but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows ( the PROPN in simple sponges , NOUN within the body wall in more complex sponges , and NOUN VERB throughout the body in the most complex sponges ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whereas PROPN line the outside of the NOUN , PROPN tend to line certain inner portions of the NOUN body that VERB the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ type of ADJ reproduction is found only in ADJ sponges and occurs through the formation of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN are ADV ADJ structures produced by adult sponges ADV the typical NOUN NOUN is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN , an inner layer of PROPN is surrounded by a layer of NOUN ( PROPN ) that may be VERB by NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> these forms may produce additional NOUN by VERB or may VERB into the ADJ form . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the life cycle ( [ link ] ) of these animals can be described as ADJ , because they exhibit both a NOUN and ADJ body plan at some point in their life cycle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN obtain food that is VERB toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the food particles enter the mouth and travel to the NOUN ( NOUN with NOUN - like structures ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> food then passes by digestive and ADJ glands , and into the stomach , then onto the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eggs and sperm are released into the water , and fertilization occurs ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the zygote then develops into a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some ADJ species , a NOUN NOUN may develop inside the young NOUN , from a series of ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> some plants , especially those that are ADJ , also increase in NOUN during their life NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth , and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> secondary growth is characterized by an increase in NOUN or NOUN of the plant , and is caused by cell division in the lateral NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN for the epidermis in mature plants . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some plants , the PROPN has many NOUN , known as NOUN , which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this VERB oxygen to the living and ADV active cells of the cortex , NOUN and phloem . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are a type of NOUN that runs above the ground and produces new NOUN plants at nodes at varying NOUN : NOUN are an example . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN arise as ADJ ends of NOUN , and contain many ADJ or unusual NOUN ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN , which functions as an ADJ storage unit , is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of ADJ ADJ leaves VERB from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem , as seen in the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most roots are ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some plants , however , also have ADJ roots , which VERB above the ground from the shoot . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the plant embryo VERB from the seed , the NOUN of the embryo forms the root system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of the root is protected by the root NOUN , a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the root NOUN is ADV replaced because it VERB VERB easily as the root VERB through soil . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water . <sent_end> <sent_begin> plant NOUN are not interested in the energy in any NUM particular ADJ system , but are very interested in water movement between NUM systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN — the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through NOUN — is a ADJ process , meaning that metabolic energy in the form of atp is not required for water movement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the energy driving NOUN is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> structures that produce NOUN for the growing plant are referred to as sources . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the points of sugar NOUN , such as roots , young NOUN , and developing seeds , are called NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> on the other hand , VERB statements are statements issued by a president when VERB to legislation that indicate how the chief executive will VERB and enforce the legislation in question . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN statements are less powerful than NOUN , though congressional opponents have VERB that they VERB legislative NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the constitution also limits the supreme court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of NOUN between states , or between the united states and foreign NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so , for the most part , the supreme court is an NOUN court , operating under ADJ jurisdiction and hearing NOUN from the lower courts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rest of the development of the judicial system and the creation of the lower courts were left in the hands of congress . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in their first case of NOUN , PROPN v. georgia ( NUM ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of NUM state against a citizen of another state , and that article PROPN , section NUM , of the constitution did not protect the states from VERB such an interstate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. georgia , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> president adams had appointed william PROPN to a position in washington , dc , but his commission was not delivered before adams left office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so PROPN VERB the supreme court to use its power under the judiciary act of NUM and issue a NOUN of NOUN to force the new president ’s secretary of state , james madison , to VERB the commission documents . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it was a task madison refused to do . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the federal court system is most often called upon when a case VERB on constitutional rights . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , when PROPN PROPN , a ADJ woman , was denied a job working for the NOUN NOUN PROPN & PROPN because a NOUN she VERB as religious practice VERB the company ’s NOUN code , the supreme court ruled that her first amendment rights had been VERB , making it possible for her to VERB the store for monetary NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a number of cases , they have expressed NOUN to expand rights without limit , and they still balance that expansion with the government ’s need to govern , provide for the common good , and serve a broader societal purpose . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the supreme court has upheld the NOUN of the death NOUN , ruling that the PROPN amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for VERB a capital crime and that the government may consider “ NOUN and the possibility of NOUN ” when it VERB capital punishment for a crime that so VERB it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. georgia , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> today ’s federal court system was not an ADJ creation ; it has been changing and VERB for more than NUM NUM years through various acts of congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since district courts are not called for in article PROPN of the constitution , congress established them and ADV defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to VERB only cases that VERB within the district . <sent_end> <sent_begin> beginning in NUM when there were just NUM , the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the u.s. court system VERB on the principle of ADJ NOUN ( latin for NOUN by things decided ) , which means that today ’s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past , and NOUN ’s rulings rely on what is decided today . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB NOUN is especially important in the u.s. common law system , in which the NOUN of NOUN VERB greater NOUN and stability in law and constitutional interpretation , and it also VERB to the NOUN and NOUN of the court system itself . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> while the federal bureaucracy grew by NOUN and NOUN during the twentieth century , it also VERB a very different evolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> beginning with the PROPN act in the NUM , the bureaucracy VERB away from the NOUN system toward a NOUN system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the distinction between these NUM forms of bureaucracy is crucial . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ model of bureaucracy is typically called the ideal PROPN model , and it was developed by PROPN PROPN , an early german sociologist . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN argued that the increasing NOUN of life would simultaneously increase the demands of citizens for government services . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> elected officials are regularly VERB when NOUN seem not follow the path they intended . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , the ADJ process becomes VERB with red NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the name for the NOUN and rules that must be followed to get something done . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN , water , and NOUN , however , are a type of public good called common goods , which are not ADJ but may be ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the problem with both public and common goods is that since no one VERB them , no one has a financial interest in protecting their long - term or future value . <sent_end> <sent_begin> without government regulation , a factory NOUN can feel free to VERB the air or water , since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the NOUN or waves carry it ADV else ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , PROPN PROPN argued that it was possible to VERB policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or VERB across the many . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM policy category , known as ADJ policy , tends to VERB payments or resources from many but VERB direct benefits on relatively few . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while ADJ policy , according to PROPN , has ADJ costs and concentrated benefits , regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement , with concentrated costs and VERB benefits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy , but its benefits are expected to be VERB ADV across society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a final type of policy is ADJ policy , so named because it VERB resources in society from NUM group to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , according to PROPN , the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits , but different groups bear the costs and VERB the benefits . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> at the more ADJ end of the foreign policy decision - making spectrum , and usually as a last NOUN when NOUN VERB , the u.s. military and defense establishment exists to provide the united states the ability to wage war against other state and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such war can be ADJ , as were the iraq war in NUM and the NUM removal of ADJ leader PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> or it can be ADJ , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the PROPN PROPN war in NUM , also known as operation PROPN PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this makes NOUN and international NOUN an ADJ NOUN as issues VERB and governmental leaders and nations change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> foreign relations are ADV made ADJ by the existence of cross - national voluntary NOUN like the united nations , the organization of american states , and the african union . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , these NOUN do not have strict enforcement authority over specific nations , unless a group of member nations takes action in some manner ( which is ultimately voluntary ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> despite the ADJ economic recovery , the job market is actually growing in some areas , but in a very ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market , with most employment opportunities at the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with ADJ skills and education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at NUM end , there has been strong demand for low - skilled , low - paying jobs in industries like food service and NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN system is NUM in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people are VERB NOUN regardless of their NOUN , interests , or potential . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> while stratification in the united states refers to the ADJ distribution of resources among individuals , global stratification refers to this ADJ distribution among nations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM NOUN to this stratification : NOUN between nations and NOUN within nations . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ , most ADJ countries were referred to as the third world and included most of ADJ - PROPN africa , latin america , and asia . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as china or PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> later , sociologist PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) added the term fourth world to refer to VERB minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the NOUN ( ADJ minority populations , NOUN , and the ADJ , for example ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , PROPN VERB that the united states is an economic NOUN that can support or VERB support to important economic legislation with far - reaching NOUN , thus VERB control over every aspect of the global economy and VERB both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can look at free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) as an example of how a core nation is able to VERB its power to gain the most ADJ position in the matter of global trade . <sent_end> <sent_begin> peripheral nations have very little NOUN ; what they do have often represents the ADJ NOUN of core nations or the NOUN and means of production owned by core nations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they typically have ADJ governments , ADJ social programs , and are ADV dependent on core nations for jobs and aid . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> their NOUN for racial groups have VERB regions ( PROPN and the PROPN PROPN , for instance ) or skin NOUN ( black , white , yellow , and red , for example ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> social science organizations including the american association of PROPN , the american sociological association , and the american psychological association have all taken an official position VERB the biological NOUN of race . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over time , the NOUN of race that developed during early racial science has VERB into NOUN , and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research in this school of thought suggests that race is not ADV ADJ and that previous racial categories were ADV VERB , based on NOUN , and used to VERB ADJ practices ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ; NOUN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN theory , developed initially from PROPN ’s ( NUM ) NOUN - aggression theory , suggests that the dominant group will VERB its ADJ aggression onto a ADJ group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> history has shown us many examples of the NOUN of a ADJ group . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN creates the ADJ “ VERB NOUN ” NOUN ; unlike the “ PROPN PROPN , ” in which each culture VERB its NOUN , the “ VERB NOUN ” ideal VERB the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , also known as NOUN , is achieved through NOUN between NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some is based on NOUN , which PROPN ( NUM ) suggests is both an NOUN and a set of institutional practices that NOUN NOUN and NOUN over other sexual NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> much like racism and NOUN , NOUN is a systematic NOUN embedded in our social institutions , VERB power to those who VERB to ADJ orientation while simultaneously VERB those who do not . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to a certain extent , men can VERB some ADJ roles and women can VERB some ADJ roles without VERB with their gender identity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gender NOUN , on the other hand , VERB some of that NOUN by taking the word " disorder " out while VERB a category that will protect patient access to care , including hormone therapy and gender NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the dsm-5 , gender NOUN is a condition of people whose gender at birth is ADJ to the one they identify with . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for a person to be VERB with gender PROPN , there must be a marked difference between the individual ’s expressed / experienced gender and the gender others would VERB him or her , and it must continue for at least NUM months . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other words , both gender and NOUN are ADV VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the social construction of NOUN refers to the way in which ADV created NOUN about the cultural NOUN of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and NOUN that link male and female behavior to biological NOUN , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN theory is an ADJ approach to NOUN studies that VERB western society ’s ADJ NOUN of gender into male and female roles and questions the manner in which we have been VERB to think about sexual orientation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN ( NUM ) , ADJ [ theory ] focuses on NOUN between ADJ sex , gender identity , and sexual orientation , not just division into male / female or ADJ / NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> there are NUM ADJ theories of aging within the conflict perspective . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN theory ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly VERB power and influence in society are the parallel forces of NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as societies VERB , the status of NOUN decreases , and they are increasingly likely to experience social NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM ADJ theory is PROPN ’s ( NUM ) NOUN of aging theory , which focuses on the shared community created by the elderly when they are VERB ( due to age ) , ADV or ADV , from VERB in other groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this theory suggests that NOUN will VERB from society and develop new patterns of interaction with NOUN who share common NOUN and interests . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> in the united states , NOUN is considered by most to be ADV ADJ and it is illegal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as NOUN and is considered a NOUN in most states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN in the united states is often associated with those of the PROPN NOUN , although in NUM the PROPN church ADV VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM percent of societies , mostly ADJ nations , follow a ADJ NOUN pattern . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN ( the NOUN of NOUN through NUM parent only ) is VERB in the other NUM percent of the world ’s societies , with high concentration in ADJ cultures ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is thought to be ADJ to women because it makes them NOUN in the home and community ; it also VERB them ADJ from their own blood NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in china , where ADJ and ADJ customs are common , the written NOUN for ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) are ADV VERB to mean “ NOUN ” and “ women ” ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> similarly , in ADJ NOUN systems , where it is ADJ for the NOUN to live with his NOUN ’s blood NOUN ( or her family of orientation ) , the NOUN can feel ADJ and can be labeled as an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN people , a ADJ society that is ADJ to the NOUN of west PROPN in PROPN , believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power in issues VERB to the home or family ( PROPN and PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is a decrease from NUM percent in NUM ( u.s. PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NUM - parent family structure is known as a nuclear family , VERB to married parents and children as the nucleus , or core , of the group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> religious experience refers to the NOUN or NOUN that we are connected to “ the PROPN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of NOUN might be experienced when people are VERB or VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular NOUN hold to be true , such as that PROPN PROPN was the NOUN of god , or that NOUN exists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another NOUN of religious beliefs is the creation NOUN we find in different NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the term NOUN , originally VERB to a political NOUN of citizens in ADJ PROPN , PROPN , now refers to a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in sociology , the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> similarly , many PROPN view the multiple NOUN of PROPN ’s NOUN as ADJ , which is a religion based on belief in multiple NOUN , , while PROPN might describe those NOUN are a ADJ parallel to the christian PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some japanese practice PROPN , which follows NOUN , which is a religion that VERB in the NOUN of ADJ NOUN , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice NOUN believe in a ADJ connection between humans and other natural NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is also important to note that every society also has NOUN , such as NOUN , who do not believe in a ADJ being or NOUN , and NOUN , who hold that ADJ reality ( such as god ) is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a christian church that has a very large NOUN VERB more than NUM people who VERB ADJ ADJ services . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as of NUM , the largest NOUN in the united states was in PROPN texas , VERB an average ADJ NOUN of more than NUM ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , ADJ education describes learning about cultural values , norms , and expected behaviors by VERB in a society . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of learning occurs both through the formal education system and at home . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> education also provides NUM of the major methods used by people for upward social NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this function is referred to as social NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> college and NOUN schools are viewed as NOUN for moving students ADV to the NOUN that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cycle of VERB those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational NOUN as well as in the ADJ NOUN , which refers to the type of ADJ knowledge that students learn through ADJ learning and cultural transmission . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ NOUN VERB the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to VERB status ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN with which symbolic NOUN concern themselves extends to the very NOUN that VERB NOUN of education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB the emphasis on NOUN or NOUN to show that a person has a certain NOUN , has VERB a certain level of education , or has met certain job NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN or NOUN serve as a NOUN of what a person has achieved , and allows the NOUN of that individual . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> indeed , the concept of power can have ADV negative NOUN , and the term itself is difficult to define . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many scholars VERB the definition developed by german sociologist PROPN PROPN , who said that power is the ability to exercise NUM ’s will over others ( PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , ADJ organizations , and governments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most people generally agree that NOUN , or the absence of organized government , does not VERB a ADJ living environment for society , but it is much ADJ for individuals to agree upon the NOUN of how a population should be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> throughout history , various forms of government have evolved to VERB the needs of changing populations and NOUN , each with NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in today ’s global political climate , NOUN far more often take the form of constitutional NOUN , governments of nations that recognize NOUN but require these NOUN to VERB by the laws of a greater constitution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many countries that are now constitutional NOUN evolved from governments that were once considered absolute NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the late PROPN PROPN - PROPN , north ADJ NOUN , and his NOUN , PROPN PROPN - PROPN , VERB this type of ADJ NOUN . some NOUN do not VERB themselves with any particular belief system or NOUN ; the goal of this type of NOUN is usually limited to VERB the authority of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ NOUN is even more ADJ and attempts to control all aspects of its subjects ’ lives ; including NOUN , religious beliefs , and number of children VERB in each family . <sent_end> <sent_begin> citizens may be forced to ADV demonstrate their NOUN in the NOUN by VERB in NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> political science looks at politics as the interaction between citizens and their government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sociology studies politics as a means to understand the underlying social norms and values of a group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a society ’s political structure and practices provide NOUN into the distribution of power and wealth , as well as larger ADJ and cultural beliefs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN found in fruit — such as the red of NOUN ( NOUN ) , the yellow of NOUN seeds ( PROPN ) , or the NOUN of an ADJ NOUN ( β - PROPN used as NOUN to attract seed NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in photosynthesis , NOUN function as photosynthetic NOUN that are very efficient molecules for the NOUN of excess energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a leaf is exposed to full sun , the light - dependent reactions are required to process an ADJ amount of energy ; if that energy is not VERB ADV , it can do significant damage . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each NOUN is VERB by the light - VERB complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple NOUN proteins that contain a mixture of NUM chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other NOUN like NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a single photon or distinct quantity or “ NOUN ” of light by any of the PROPN VERB that molecule into an excited state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in short , the light energy has now been VERB by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the reaction center of PROPN ( called PROPN ) VERB its high - energy electrons , NUM at the time , to the primary electron NOUN , and through the electron transport chain ( PROPN to NOUN complex to VERB ) to PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s VERB electron is replaced by VERB a low - energy electron from water ; thus , water is split and PROPN is re - reduced after every NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the number of carbon atoms remains the same , as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions ( NUM atoms from NUM + NUM atoms from NUM = NUM atoms in NUM atoms of NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process is called carbon NOUN , because PROPN is “ fixed ” from an inorganic form into organic molecules . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> communication between cells is called ADJ signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the NOUN : PROPN means " between " ( for example , VERB lines are those that cross each other ) and NOUN means " inside " ( like ADJ signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually ADJ or ADJ molecules called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , VERB a signal in the process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> signals that act ADV between cells that are close together are called ADJ signals . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when these NOUN reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a NOUN of the next cell by the release of chemical NOUN called neurotransmitters by the ADJ cell ( the cell VERB the signal ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small NOUN between nerve cells , which are called chemical NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly ; this enables an immediate response , such as , take your hand off the NOUN PUNCT <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gap NOUN in animals and NOUN in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of NOUN cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these water - filled channels allow small signaling molecules , called intracellular NOUN , to VERB between the NUM cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> small molecules , such as calcium ions ( NUM + ) , are able to move between cells , but large molecules like proteins and dna can not fit through the channels . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each cell - surface receptor has NUM main components : an external ligand - binding NOUN , a ADJ membrane - VERB region , and an intracellular NOUN inside the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ligand - binding NOUN is also called the extracellular NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the size and extent of each of these NOUN vary widely , depending on the type of receptor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> enzyme - linked receptors are cell - surface receptors with intracellular NOUN that are associated with an enzyme . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in some cases , the intracellular NOUN of the receptor itself is an enzyme . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in some cases , binding of the ligand causes NOUN of the receptor , which means that NUM receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a chemical compound formed when NUM molecules ( often identical ) join together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular NOUN to come into close contact and VERB each other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are also often added to NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN NOUN of proteins , where they VERB the NOUN group of the amino acid ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the transfer of the phosphate is VERB by an enzyme called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> various NOUN are named for the substrate they VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ PROPN is VERB by the enzyme ADP NOUN from atp ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the main role of camp in cells is to bind to and VERB an enzyme called camp - dependent NOUN ( a - NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a - NOUN VERB many ADJ metabolic NOUN : it VERB NOUN and NOUN NOUN of its target proteins , VERB them in the process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the second kind of protein with which PROPN can interact is a protein that acts as an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a molecule that binds to a protein and VERB it from functioning or reduces its function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , the NOUN is a protein called PROPN - b , which binds to the regulatory protein PROPN - PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> inside the cell , many different enzymes reverse the cellular NOUN that result from signaling NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NOUN are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by NOUN in a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ PROPN ( camp ) is VERB into PROPN by NOUN , and the release of calcium stores is VERB by the NOUN + NOUN that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the population density of the bacteria VERB a certain level , specific gene expression is VERB , and the bacteria produce ADJ proteins that VERB light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the number of cells present in the environment ( cell density ) is the determining factor for signaling , bacterial signaling was named NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in politics and business , a NOUN is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> before VERB the steps a cell must VERB to VERB , a ADJ understanding of the structure and function of a cell ’s genetic information is necessary . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a cell ’s dna , VERB as a double - VERB dna molecule , is called its genome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in prokaryotes , the genome is composed of a single , double - VERB dna molecule in the form of a loop or NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is VERB NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> human cells that contain NUM set of chromosomes are called gametes , or sex cells ; these are eggs and sperm , and are VERB NUM , or haploid . there are NUM pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human ADJ cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus ( top ) , removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a NOUN ( right ) , and ADV VERB according to length ( left ) ; an arrangement like this is called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the first level of NOUN , short NOUN of the dna double helix NOUN around a core of NUM NOUN proteins at ADJ NOUN along the entire length of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the dna - NOUN complex is called NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when fully ADJ , the pairs of ADV VERB chromosomes are bound to each other by PROPN proteins . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the connection between the sister chromatids is ADJ in a region called the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ sister chromatids , with a diameter of about NUM INTJ , are visible under a light microscope . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during NOUN , the cell VERB and dna is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the ADJ phase , the VERB dna and ADJ NOUN are separated , and the cell VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is VERB during the s phase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM NOUN will give rise to the ADJ NOUN , the NOUN that VERB the movement of chromosomes during mitosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the center of each animal cell , the NOUN of animal cells are associated with a pair of NOUN - like objects , the NOUN , which are at right NOUN to each other . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ phase is a ADJ process during which the VERB chromosomes are aligned , separated , and move into NUM new , identical daughter cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first portion of the ADJ phase is called PROPN , or nuclear division . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second portion of the ADJ phase , called NOUN , is the physical separation of the ADJ components into the NUM daughter cells . link to learning <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN that will form the ADJ NOUN extend between the NOUN , VERB them ADV apart as the ADJ fibers VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sister chromatids begin to VERB more ADV with the aid of PROPN proteins and become visible under a light microscope . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during NOUN , the “ change phase , ” all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the NOUN NOUN , or the ADJ plane , ADV between the NUM NOUN of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sister chromatids are still ADV attached to each other by PROPN proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN , or “ cell motion , ” is the second main stage of the ADJ phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the ADJ components into NUM daughter cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> division is not complete until the cell components have been VERB and completely separated into the NUM daughter cells . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> not all cells VERB to the ADJ cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the ADJ phases of NOUN , closely followed by the ADJ phase . <sent_end> <sent_begin> cells in NOUN phase are not actively VERB to divide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell is in a ADJ ( ADJ ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the genes that code for the positive cell cycle NOUN are called NOUN - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN - NOUN are normal genes that , when VERB in certain ways , become NOUN , genes that cause a cell to become ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM groups of proteins , called NOUN and NOUN - dependent NOUN ( PROPN ) , are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the levels of the NUM ADJ proteins VERB throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN proteins of bacteria are , however , related to the PROPN and PROPN proteins involved in the chromosome NOUN of NOUN . the bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the NOUN of the cell . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the starting point of replication , the origin , is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> replication of the dna is ADJ , moving away from the origin on both NOUN of the loop simultaneously . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> sexual reproduction requires fertilization , the union of NUM cells from NUM individual organisms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if those NUM cells each contain NUM set of chromosomes , then the resulting cell contains NUM sets of chromosomes . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> during dna NOUN in the s phase , each chromosome is VERB to produce NUM identical NOUN , called sister chromatids , that are held together at the NOUN by PROPN proteins . PROPN holds the chromatids together until PROPN ii . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN complex supports the exchange of ADJ NOUN between non - sister homologous chromatids , a process called NOUN over . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB over can be observed ADV after the exchange as PROPN ( singular = PROPN ) ( [ PROPN species such as humans , even though the x and y sex chromosomes are not homologous ( most of their genes differ ) , they have a small region of NOUN that allows the x and y chromosomes to pair up during NOUN i . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a partial NOUN complex develops only between the regions of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> following NOUN , the VERB complex VERB down and the NOUN connection between homologous pairs is also removed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at the end of NOUN i , the pairs are held together only at the PROPN ( [ link ] ) and are called NOUN because the NUM sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fertilization and meiosis ADJ in sexual life cycles . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what happens between these NUM events depends on the organism . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> species with NOUN of NOUN have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the haploid multicellular plants are called NOUN , because they produce gametes from specialized cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case , because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NUM , he published his work , experiments in plant PROPN in the NOUN of the natural history society of PROPN . mendel ’s work went ADV ADJ by the scientific community that believed , ADV , that the process of inheritance involved a NOUN of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring ; this ADJ process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height . <sent_end> <sent_begin> offspring appear to be a “ NOUN ” of their parents ’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel performed NOUN , which involve mating NUM true - VERB individuals that have different traits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the NOUN , which is naturally self - VERB , this is done by ADV VERB pollen from the NOUN of a mature NOUN plant of NUM variety to the NOUN of a separate mature NOUN plant of the second variety . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once mendel VERB the characteristics in the ADJ generation of plants , he allowed them to self - VERB naturally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he then collected and grew the seeds from the PROPN plants to produce the NOUN , or second ADJ , generation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel ’s experiments extended beyond the PROPN generation to the PROPN and PROPN NOUN , and so on , but it was the ratio of characteristics in the PROPN NOUN that were the most ADJ and became the basis for mendel ’s NOUN . in NUM of his experiments on inheritance patterns , mendel VERB plants that were true - NOUN for ADJ flower color with plants true - NOUN for white flower color ( the p generation ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he called these , respectively , dominant and recessive traits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> dominant traits are those that are inherited ADJ in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recessive traits become ADJ , or VERB , in the offspring of a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the other hand , the sum rule of probability is applied when VERB NUM ADV exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than NUM pathway . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the sum rule states that the probability of the NOUN of NUM event or the other event , of NUM ADV exclusive events , is the sum of their individual NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both ADV visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel ’s NOUN experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when fertilization occurs between NUM true - VERB parents that differ in only NUM characteristic , the process is called a PROPN cross , and the resulting offspring are NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> mendel performed NUM NOUN VERB involving VERB traits for each characteristic . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> of course , doing a test cross in humans is ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , NOUN use NOUN analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although individual humans ( and all diploid organisms ) can only have NUM alleles for a given gene , multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many NOUN of NUM alleles are observed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to VERB the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often VERB “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all other NOUN or NOUN are considered NOUN of this standard , meaning that they VERB from the wild type . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the y chromosome contains a small region of NOUN to the x chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis , the y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a gene being VERB is present on the x chromosome , but not on the y chromosome , it is said to be x - linked . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for instance , the recessive ADJ ADJ allele in PROPN affects wing shape in the NOUN form but is ADJ in the NOUN . a single NOUN of the wild - type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the dominant ADJ inheritance pattern is NUM in which an allele is ADJ both in the NOUN and the NOUN ; this allele can only be transmitted if the NOUN phenotype occurs after reproductive age . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals with mutations that result in dominant ADJ alleles VERB to survive even in the NOUN form . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> mendel ’s law of independent ADJ states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the NOUN of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the independent NOUN of genes can be illustrated by the PROPN cross , a cross between NUM true - VERB parents that express different traits for NUM characteristics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , the interaction between genes is ADJ , such that NUM gene NOUN or VERB with the expression of another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ PROPN ” is a word composed of greek roots that mean “ standing upon . ” the alleles that are being VERB or VERB are said to be ADJ to the ADJ alleles that are doing the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if the genes are ADJ , the individual should produce PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN gametes with equal frequencies , according to the ADJ concept of independent NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because they correspond to new allele NOUN , the NOUN PROPN and PROPN are ADJ types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> parental types are ADJ that exhibit the same ADJ combination as their parents . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such a result would indicate that the genes were ADV linked , but that they were far enough apart for NOUN to ADV occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN divided his genetic map into map units , or PROPN ( PROPN ) , in which a recombination frequency of NUM VERB to NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by representing alleles in a linear map , PROPN suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked ( recombination frequency = NUM ) to being perfectly ADJ ( recombination frequency = NUM ) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perfectly ADJ genes correspond to the frequencies VERB by mendel to VERB ADV in a PROPN cross . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in a given species , chromosomes can be identified by their number , size , NOUN position , and NOUN pattern . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a human NOUN , NOUN or “ body chromosomes ” ( all of the non – sex chromosomes ) are generally organized in ADJ order of size from largest ( chromosome NUM ) to VERB ( chromosome NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the x and y chromosomes are not NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called PROPN ; in humans , PROPN VERB to NUM pairs of NOUN and NUM pair of sex chromosomes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as PROPN , a term that includes NOUN ( loss of NUM chromosome ) or NOUN ( gain of an ADJ chromosome ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather than a gain or loss of NOUN , variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively ADJ effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in part , this occurs because of a molecular process called x NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> early in development , when female ADJ NOUN consist of just a few NUM cells ( relative to NOUN in the NOUN ) , NUM x chromosome in each cell VERB by ADV VERB into a ADJ ( ADJ ) structure called a PROPN body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN occurs when a segment of a chromosome VERB and VERB to a different , ADJ chromosome . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be ADJ or have ADJ effects depending on how the positions of genes are VERB with respect to regulatory sequences . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an enzyme called NOUN VERB the dna by VERB the hydrogen bonds between the ADJ base pairs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> atp NOUN is required for this process . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the problem is VERB with the help of a NOUN that provides the free NUM end . <sent_end> <sent_begin> another enzyme , rna NOUN , VERB an rna NOUN that is about NUM to NUM nucleotides long and complementary to the dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because this sequence VERB the dna synthesis , it is ADV called the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this ADV VERB strand is known as the leading strand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other strand , complementary to the NUM ' to NUM ' parental dna , is extended away from the replication NOUN , in small fragments known as PROPN fragments , each requiring a NOUN to start the synthesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN fragments are named after the japanese scientist who first discovered them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the VERB NOUN is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the dna and holds the polymerase in place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB the over - NOUN of the dna double helix ADV of the replication NOUN as the dna is opening up ; it does so by causing ADJ NOUN in the dna helix and then VERB it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as synthesis NOUN , the rna NOUN are replaced by dna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some NOUN are not VERB during replication , but are instead VERB after replication is completed ; this type of NOUN is known as NOUN NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the enzymes recognize the ADV added nucleotide and NOUN it ; this is then replaced by the correct base . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> such mutations may be of NUM types : induced or ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , PROPN rays , x - rays , or some other environmental NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental NOUN ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as ADJ mutations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most common nucleotide mutations are NOUN , in which NUM base is replaced by another . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ends of the linear chromosomes are known as NOUN , which have ADJ sequences that code for no particular gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a way , these NOUN protect the genes from getting VERB as cells continue to divide . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the translation to protein is a NOUN more complex because NUM mrna nucleotides correspond to NUM amino acid in the polypeptide sequence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the translation to protein is still systematic and ADJ , such that nucleotides NUM to NUM correspond to amino acid NUM , nucleotides NUM to NUM correspond to amino acid NUM , and so on . NOUN on dna are VERB onto PROPN rna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are able to read the genetic information VERB on a strand of NOUN rna and use this information to VERB amino acids together into a protein . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these nucleotide NOUN are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of NUM or NUM nucleotides completely changed the NOUN reading frame , ADV VERB the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> though NOUN of NUM nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be VERB during translation , the NOUN of the rest of the protein was maintained . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN can be transferred ADV of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as ADJ resistance . transcription in prokaryotes ( and in NOUN ) requires the dna double helix to ADV VERB in the region of mrna synthesis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the region of NOUN is called a transcription NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> transcription always VERB from the same dna strand for each gene , which is called the template strand . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the mrna product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other dna strand , called the PROPN strand . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that VERB to the site from which the first NUM ' mrna nucleotide is VERB is called the SYM site , or the initiation site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nucleotides VERB the initiation site are given negative numbers and are VERB ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are VERB with “ + ” NOUN and are called ADJ nucleotides . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> without NOUN , the core enzyme would VERB from random sites and would produce mrna molecules that VERB protein NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the polymerase VERB of all NUM subunits is called the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM is protein - based and the other is rna - based . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN - dependent NOUN is controlled by the NOUN protein , which VERB along behind the polymerase on the growing mrna chain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> near the end of the gene , the polymerase VERB a run of g nucleotides on the dna template and it VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rna polymerase PROPN is also located in the nucleus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this polymerase VERB a variety of structural NOUN that includes the PROPN pre - ADJ , transfer pre - ADJ ( pre - ADJ ) , and small nuclear pre - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN have a critical role in translation ; they serve as the NOUN molecules between the mrna template and the growing polypeptide chain . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN and NOUN affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a NOUN complex on the dna template that ADV VERB rna polymerase ii for transcription initiation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the VERB amino acid must be added later , once the PROPN is VERB and VERB to the cytoplasm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> through the process of PROPN “ VERB , ” each PROPN molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called PROPN PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> at least NUM type of PROPN PROPN PROPN exists for each of the NUM amino acids ; the ADJ number of PROPN PROPN NOUN varies by species . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many eukaryotic PROPN are VERB from the first PROPN , but this is not always the case . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to PROPN ’s rules , the nucleotides around the PROPN indicate whether it is the correct start NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s rules state that the following NOUN sequence must appear around the PROPN of ADJ genes : NUM ' . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> usually , this is because the mrna is VERB several NOUN nucleotides . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the cell VERB an additional rna processing step called rna NOUN to VERB this . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> eukaryotic genes are composed of NOUN , which correspond to protein - VERB sequences ( NOUN - on VERB that they are expressed ) , and VERB sequences called NOUN ( PROPN - PROPN VERB their VERB role ) , which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre - mrna during processing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN sequences in mrna do not VERB functional proteins . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information VERB in their dna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process of VERB on a gene to produce rna and protein is called gene expression . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whether in a simple ADJ organism or a complex ADJ - cellular organism , each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in prokaryotic cells , there are NUM types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of NOUN : NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are proteins that VERB transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus , whereas NOUN are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , NOUN are small molecules that either VERB or VERB transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the NOUN of substrate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM VERB regions for the NOUN NOUN enzymes are VERB ADV on the chromosome in the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just before the VERB region is the ADJ start site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is the region of dna to which rna polymerase binds to VERB transcription . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just as the NOUN NOUN is ADV regulated by NOUN molecules , there are proteins that bind to the NOUN sequences that act as a positive NOUN to turn genes on and VERB them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , when glucose is ADJ , e . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> when transcription factors bind to the NOUN just ADV of the VERB gene , it is referred to as a NOUN - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site . <sent_end> <sent_begin> transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and VERB transcription of the gene that is needed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NUM ' NOUN , which is placed on the NUM ' end of the mrna , is usually composed of a VERB NOUN NOUN molecule ( gtp ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ - a tail , which is attached to the NUM ' end , is usually composed of a series of NOUN nucleotides . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once the rna is transported to the cytoplasm , the length of time that the rna VERB there can be controlled . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather , these are regions that regulate mrna NOUN , stability , and protein translation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the region just before the protein - VERB region is called the NUM ' PROPN , whereas the region after the VERB region is called the NUM ' PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the binding of NOUN to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an rna molecule , depending on the specific NOUN that binds . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these pre - PROPN are VERB into mature NOUN by a protein called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like transcription factors and NOUN , mature PROPN recognize a specific sequence and bind to the rna ; however , PROPN also associate with a NOUN complex called the rna - induced NOUN complex ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN binds along with the PROPN to VERB the target mrna . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the first protein to bind to the rna to VERB translation is the eukaryotic initiation PROPN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule NOUN NOUN ( gtp ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming NOUN NOUN ( gdp ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at this point , when the NOUN complex is VERB , the gtp is converted into gdp and energy is released . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the phosphate and the PROPN protein are released from the complex and the large NUM NOUN NOUN binds to VERB the rna . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the binding of PROPN to the rna is controlled by NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> PROPN blocks NOUN binding sites on ADJ molecules , preventing cross - ADJ formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN binds to PROPN and helps to position it on the ADJ molecule ; it also binds calcium ions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> bone , or ADJ tissue , is a connective tissue that VERB the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it contains specialized cells and a matrix of NOUN NOUN and NOUN fibers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> long bones are longer than they are wide and have a NOUN and NUM ends . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , or central NOUN , contains bone NOUN in a NOUN cavity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ ends , the NOUN , are covered with ADJ NOUN and are filled with red bone NOUN , which produces blood cells ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples of flat bones are the NOUN ( NOUN bone ) , NOUN , NOUN ( NOUN NOUN ) , and the NOUN of the skull ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ bones are small , flat , ADV shaped bones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they may be found between the flat bones of the skull . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN consists of NOUN , which are layers of ADJ matrix that VERB a central canal called the PROPN canal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ canal ( PROPN canal ) contains the bone ’s blood vessels and nerve fibers ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ bone tissue does not contain NOUN that VERB ADJ bone tissue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> instead , it consists of PROPN , which are NOUN that are VERB as NOUN or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> red bone NOUN is found between the PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> bone may also be VERB for NOUN , if the applied NOUN have changed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue ; these cells can not divide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN maintain normal bone structure by VERB the NOUN NOUN in the bony matrix . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is the process of bone development from ADJ membranes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull , the NOUN , and the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN at the bone surface secrete bone matrix , and NOUN on the inner surface break down bone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from the NOUN cavity , air passes through the NOUN ( NOUN ) and the NOUN ( voice PROPN ) , as it makes its way to the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the main function of the NOUN is to VERB the VERB air to the lungs and the VERB air back out of the body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the lungs , air is VERB into smaller and smaller NOUN , or NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> air enters the lungs through the NUM primary ( main ) NOUN ( singular : NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN VERB into secondary NOUN , then into ADJ NOUN , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter NOUN as they split and spread through the lung . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they lack NOUN and therefore rely on VERB air to support their shape . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the NOUN decrease in diameter , the relative amount of smooth muscle increases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN VERB into ADJ branches called ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN VERB into several NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the air that organisms VERB contains NOUN matter such as NOUN , NOUN , viral particles , and bacteria that can damage the lungs or VERB ADJ immune responses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ system contains several ADJ mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at ADJ capacity , an average lung can hold almost NUM NOUN of air , but lungs do not usually operate at ADJ capacity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung NOUN and lung NOUN ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> volume measures the amount of air for NUM function ( such as NOUN or NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is the reserve amount that can be VERB beyond what is normal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> conversely , the PROPN reserve volume ( PROPN ) is the additional amount of air that can be VERB after a normal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ volume ( PROPN ) is the amount of air that is left after PROPN reserve volume is VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is the sum of the PROPN reserve volume , ADJ volume , and PROPN reserve volume . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ capacity ( PROPN ) is the amount of air that can be VERB after the end of a normal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is , therefore , the sum of the ADJ volume and ADJ reserve volume . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> lung NOUN are measured by a technique called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an important measurement taken during NOUN is the forced ADJ volume ( PROPN ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually NUM second ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> gas exchange across the PROPN the body , oxygen is used by cells of the body ’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN varies between NUM and NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> no muscles are VERB to VERB the air . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each lung is surrounded by an ADJ sac . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the layer of tissue that covers the lung and VERB into spaces is called the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a second layer of ADJ NOUN lines the interior of the PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the number of NOUN per NOUN is the ADJ rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on average , under non - ADJ conditions , the human ADJ rate is NUM – NUM NOUN / NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid - air NOUN of a water NOUN that results in the NOUN of the water molecules together . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a complex mixture of NOUN and NOUN that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the NOUN tissue and the air found within the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> by VERB the surface tension of the ADJ fluid , it reduces the tendency of NOUN to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> examples of ADJ diseases are ADJ distress syndrome and ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in both diseases , the PROPN are less ADJ and they are ADJ or ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it is also independent of ADJ output . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is because of a phenomenon called NOUN , which is the process of opening NOUN that normally remain closed when ADJ output increases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as ADJ output increases , the number of NOUN and arteries that are VERB ( filled with blood ) increases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> dead space is created when no NOUN and/or NOUN takes place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ dead space or ADJ NOUN , VERB from an ADJ failure , while physiological dead space or physiological NOUN , VERB from a functional NOUN of the lung or arteries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the binding of oxygen to NOUN can be VERB as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood ( x - axis ) versus the relative PROPN - oxygen NOUN ( y - axis ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting graph — an oxygen NOUN curve — is ADJ , or s - shaped ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the partial pressure of oxygen increases , the NOUN becomes increasingly VERB with oxygen . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is ADJ when it occurs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a rare genetic disease caused by a NOUN in either the NOUN or the NOUN NOUN of PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> patients with NOUN produce a high number of red blood cells , but these cells have lower - than - normal levels of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this system , carbon dioxide VERB into the red blood cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) within the red blood cells quickly VERB the carbon dioxide into ADJ acid ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ acid is an ADJ intermediate molecule that immediately VERB into NOUN ions <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as opposed to a closed system , NOUN — including insects , NOUN , and most NOUN — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link ] b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an open circulatory system , the blood is not VERB in the blood vessels but is VERB into a cavity called a NOUN and is called NOUN because the blood VERB with the ADJ fluid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the heart VERB and the animal moves , the NOUN VERB around the organs within the body cavity and then VERB the NOUN through NOUN called PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN VERB blood that has VERB from the body and the NOUN VERB the blood to the NOUN where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - ADJ ; this is called PROPN circulation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the blood then continues through the rest of the body before VERB back at the NOUN ; this is called ADJ circulation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this ADJ flow of blood produces a gradient of ADJ to ADJ blood around the fish ’s ADJ circuit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as shown in [ link ] b , NOUN have a NUM - ADJ heart that has NUM NOUN and NUM NOUN rather than the NUM - ADJ heart of fish . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM NOUN ( ADJ heart NOUN ) receive blood from the NUM different NOUN ( the lungs and the systems ) , and then there is some NOUN of the blood in the heart ’s NOUN ( ADJ heart chamber ) , which reduces the efficiency of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels VERB blood to the lungs and body . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> blood supports growth by VERB nutrients and hormones , and by VERB waste . <sent_end> <sent_begin> blood plays a ADJ role by VERB NOUN factors and NOUN to prevent blood loss and VERB the disease - fighting NOUN or white blood cells to sites of infection . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN are the NOUN that receive blood , and the NOUN are the NOUN that VERB blood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the right NOUN receives ADJ blood from the ADJ PROPN PROPN , which VERB blood from the NOUN NOUN that comes from the brain and from the NOUN that come from the arms , as well as from the ADJ PROPN PROPN which VERB blood from the NOUN that come from the lower organs and the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in addition , the right NOUN receives blood from the ADJ NOUN which VERB ADJ blood from the heart itself . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the left NOUN then receives the oxygen - rich blood from the lungs via the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this blood passes through the ADJ NOUN or ADJ NOUN ( the ADJ NOUN on the left side of the heart ) to the left NOUN where the blood is VERB out through NOUN , the major NOUN of the body , taking ADJ blood to the organs and muscles of the body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once blood is VERB out of the left NOUN and into the NOUN , the ADJ ADJ NOUN ( or ADJ NOUN ) VERB preventing blood from VERB ADV into the left NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the NOUN of the heart wall . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the outer layer of cells is called the NOUN , of which the second layer is a ADJ ADJ structure called the NOUN that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for ADJ NOUN but also VERB the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the heart muscle will die without a ADJ supply of blood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the NOUN of an NOUN by the NOUN of fatty NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the size ( ADJ ) of the ADJ arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , NOUN can be ADJ in these arteries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the human heart VERB over NUM times per day . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in each ADJ cycle , the heart NOUN ( NOUN ) , VERB out the blood and VERB it through the body ; this is followed by a relaxation phase ( PROPN ) , where the heart VERB with blood , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN contract at the same time , VERB blood through the ADJ NOUN into the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the electrical NOUN in the heart produce electrical NOUN that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this information can be observed as an NOUN ( PROPN ) — a NOUN of the electrical NOUN of the ADJ muscle . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN VERB into capillary NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> capillary NOUN contain a large number ( NUM to NUM ) of NOUN that branch among the cells and tissues of the body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are ADJ - diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single NOUN and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients , waste , and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN , this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the ADJ cells and red blood cells , as well as the exchange site via NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the movement of materials at the site of NOUN is regulated by NOUN , VERB of the blood vessels , and NOUN , VERB of the blood vessels ; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> throughout the ADJ cycle , the blood continues to VERB into the NOUN at a relatively even rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to ADJ pressure caused by an NOUN of molecules on either side of the membrane . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is the process of maintenance of NOUN and water balance ( ADJ balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus NOUN and non - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a NOUN that VERB into ions when VERB in water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the body ’s fluids include blood plasma , the NOUN within cells , and ADJ fluid , the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the membranes of the body ( such as the NOUN , ADJ , and cell membranes ) are semi - ADJ membranes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> semi - ADJ membranes are ADJ ( or ADJ ) to certain types of NOUN and water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of a solution is the number of NOUN of NOUN per NOUN of solution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a solution is the number of NOUN of NOUN per NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the NOUN is water , NUM NOUN of water is equal to NUM NOUN of water . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the kidneys , illustrated in [ link ] , are a pair of NOUN - shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the ADJ cavity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the adrenal glands VERB on top of each kidney and are also called the ADJ glands . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the outermost layer is a ADJ connective tissue layer called the renal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second layer is called the ADJ fat PROPN , which helps VERB the kidneys in place . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the third and ADJ layer is the renal NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN is the ADJ part of the NOUN - shape where blood vessels and NOUN enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the renal cortex is ADJ due to the presence of NOUN — the functional unit of the kidney . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the medulla consists of multiple ADJ tissue NOUN , called the renal NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are , on average , NUM renal NOUN in each kidney . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the renal NOUN along with the VERB ADJ region are called the NOUN of the kidney . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the renal NOUN leads to the NOUN on the outside of the kidney . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on the inside of the kidney , the renal VERB branches out into NUM or NUM NOUN called the major NOUN , which further branch into the minor NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN are NOUN - VERB tubes that exit the kidney and ADJ into the ADJ bladder . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the renal arteries split into several ADJ arteries upon entering the kidneys . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each ADJ NOUN VERB further into several PROPN arteries and enters the renal NOUN , which supply the renal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN arteries split at the NOUN of the renal cortex and medulla to form the ADJ arteries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each kidney is made up of over NUM NUM NOUN that VERB the renal cortex , giving it a ADJ appearance when VERB ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are NUM types of NOUN — ADJ NOUN ( NUM percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and PROPN NOUN ( NUM percent ) , which VERB in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN consists of NUM parts — a renal NOUN , a renal NOUN , and the associated capillary network , which VERB from the ADJ VERB arteries . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the renal NOUN is a long and ADJ structure that VERB from the NOUN and can be divided into NUM parts based on function . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first part is called the ADJ ADJ NOUN ( PROPN ) due to its NOUN to the NOUN ; it VERB in the renal cortex . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second part is called the loop of PROPN , or NOUN loop , because it forms a loop ( with VERB and VERB NOUN ) that goes through the renal medulla . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the capillary network that VERB from the renal arteries VERB the NOUN with blood that needs to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the branch that enters the NOUN is called the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the branch that VERB the NOUN is called the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ NOUN , the ADJ capillary network surrounds the PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in PROPN NOUN , the ADJ capillary network forms a network around the loop of PROPN and is called the X NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> water is also VERB during this step . <sent_end> <sent_begin> then , additional NOUN and NOUN are secreted into the kidney NOUN during ADJ NOUN , which is , in NOUN , the opposite process to ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the VERB NOUN VERB NOUN coming from the NOUN and fuse in the ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ gradient increases as it moves ADV into the medulla . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because NUM sides of the loop of PROPN perform VERB functions , as illustrated in [ link ] , it acts as a NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the X NOUN around it acts as the NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> art connection <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> many NOUN had written on economics in the centuries before smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a ADJ way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the first chapter , smith VERB the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how can macroeconomic policy be used to VERB these goals ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank NOUN , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for the united states , this is the federal reserve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they VERB issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular NOUN about human behavior , that are different than the NOUN an NOUN or psychologist might use . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a theory is a ADJ representation of how NUM or more variables interact with each other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and VERB it down to its NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB the economy as consisting of NUM groups — households and firms — that interact in NUM markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although NOUN economies have a very ADJ structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very ADJ structure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a market is an institution that VERB together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the new york stock exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a ADJ example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> exports are the goods and services that are produced ADV and sold abroad . <sent_end> <sent_begin> imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the size of total production in an economy is measured by the ADJ domestic product ( gdp ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of NUM NOUN is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people VERB goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide . <sent_end> <sent_begin> utility , as we will see in the chapter on consumer choices , is ADJ but that does not make it less real . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this section of the chapter will explain the NOUN faced by society , using a model called the production NOUN frontier ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are more NOUN than differences between individual choice and social choice . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of VERB returns , which holds that as additional NOUN of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional NOUN will decline . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when government VERB a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ efficiency means that the particular NOUN of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> how to determine what a society NOUN can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather , it VERB to describe economic behavior as it actually exists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and ADJ statements , which describe how the world should be . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , an economist could VERB a proposed NOUN system in a certain city . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but even if the budget constraint or a NOUN shifts , NOUN remains — just at a different level . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second NOUN is NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as VERB in the budget constraint or the production NOUN frontier , it is necessary to give up some of NUM good to gain more of the other good . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter VERB information about ADJ choices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( PROPN ) or supplied ( PROPN ) and the ADJ percent change in price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be ADV divided into NUM broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an elastic demand or elastic supply is NUM in which the elasticity is greater than NUM , VERB a high NOUN to changes in price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN that are less than NUM indicate low NOUN to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN indicate proportional NOUN of either demand or supply , as VERB in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> recall that the elasticity between these NUM points was NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> demand was inelastic between points a and b and elastic between points g and PROPN this shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM elasticity or perfect NOUN , as VERB in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in NUM change in quantity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the example of NOUN taxes VERB that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of NOUN , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> typically , the NOUN , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the VERB good . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the cross - price elasticity of demand VERB some NOUN on the bones of these ideas . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of NUM good is VERB the quantity demanded of a different good . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> let ’s define what is meant by the firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a firm ( or business ) VERB inputs of labor , capital , land , and ADJ or ADJ component materials to produce NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the firm is successful , the NOUN are more ADJ than the inputs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can distinguish between NUM types of cost : explicit and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> explicit costs are out - of - NOUN costs , that is , payments that are actually made . <sent_end> <sent_begin> wages that a firm pays its employees or VERB that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and ADJ costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is ADV successful depends on its economic profit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term . <sent_end> <sent_begin> whether you produce a NOUN or a little , the fixed costs are the same . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the total cost of producing NUM NOUN is $ NUM , the average total cost for producing each of NUM NOUN is $ NUM , or $ NUM per NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level NOUN to PROPN , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this situation is called NOUN of scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to VERB , resulting in ADV high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as NOUN to communicate lead to NOUN in the flow of work and materials . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the total number of units VERB at that price is called the quantity demanded . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when economists VERB about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> price is what the producer receives for selling NUM unit of a good or service . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> like demand , supply can be illustrated using a NOUN or a graph . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a supply schedule is a NOUN , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> again , price is measured in dollars per NOUN of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the point where the supply curve ( s ) and the demand curve ( d ) cross , VERB by point e in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . this common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a NOUN — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now VERB the quantity supplied , which had been VERB by the lower price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this situation , ADJ gasoline buyers VERB the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no ADJ economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists call this assumption ADJ NOUN , a latin NOUN meaning “ other things being equal . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> any given demand or supply curve is based on the ADJ ADJ assumption that all else is held equal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between NUM , and only NUM , variables when all other variables are VERB constant . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of elderly citizens in the united states population is rising . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it VERB from NUM % in NUM to NUM % in NUM , and will be a VERB ( by the u.s. PROPN bureau ) NUM % of the population by NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> these changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following work it out feature shows how this happens . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , in NUM the PROPN PROPN in PROPN china , which produces most of the country 's NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN , experienced its most severe NOUN in NUM years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good NOUN would shift the supply curve to the right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a firm VERB a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort VERB the green revolution focused on NOUN ADJ seeds for basic NOUN like NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> “ well , it is clear that a NOUN reduces supply , so i will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve NOUN to NOUN shown on the diagram ( called shift NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so the equilibrium moves from NOUN to NOUN , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher . <sent_end> <sent_begin> then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from NOUN to PROPN , on the diagram ( shown as shift NUM ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from NOUN to NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and VERB up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the common agricultural policy reform passed in NUM , the european union ( PROPN ) will spend about NUM NUM NOUN per year , or NUM NUM dollars per year , or roughly NUM % of the PROPN budget , on price supports for europe ’s farmers from NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that VERB a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for NOUN in europe . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the absence of government NOUN , the price would VERB so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point PROPN , with price NOUN and quantity INTJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at that above - equilibrium NOUN , excess supply or a surplus results . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many NOUN for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN ’ NOUN will move down toward equilibrium . in contrast , if the NOUN is below the equilibrium at , say , $ NUM per year , then a situation of excess demand or a NOUN VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in NOUN NUM , the u.s. minimum wage was raised to $ NUM per hour . <sent_end> <sent_begin> local political movements in a number of u.s. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a ADJ standard of living . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , each consumer VERB according to that person ’s NOUN and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer VERB to the impact on its expected profits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the following clear it up feature VERB the demand and supply models . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can VERB , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a budget constraint line , the quantity of NUM good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that VERB additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a VERB rate . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the third NOUN shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by NUM additional unit of consumption . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this equation for marginal utility is : PROPN = change in total utility change in quantity PROPN = change in total utility change in quantity <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB that marginal utility VERB as additional units are VERB , which means that each subsequent unit of a good VERB provides less additional utility . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when VERB utility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the price of t - NOUN is ADV as high as the price of NOUN , to VERB utility the last t - NOUN VERB needs to provide exactly DET the marginal utility ( PROPN ) of the last NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how does this rise in income alter her utility - VERB choice ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from NOUN NOUN and ADJ NOUN and seek her utility - VERB choice on the new budget line . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but how will her new choice relate to her original choice ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this occurs for NUM reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> again , let ’s VERB with a ADJ example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the economic NOUN is ADV the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the NOUN are different on a labor - NOUN budget constraint . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] and [ link ] show PROPN ’s ADJ budget constraint . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s choice involves VERB the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> and what ’s more , actions under these conditions are indeed predictable , if the underlying environment is better understood . <sent_end> <sent_begin> so , behavioral economics VERB to VERB the understanding of decision - making by VERB the NOUN of psychology into economics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it does this by VERB how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> industries differ from NUM another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is referred to as the market structure of the industry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this chapter , we focus on perfect competition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a perfectly competitive firm has only NUM major decision to make — ADV , what quantity to produce . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ NUM and a quantity of NUM produced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the NOUN started out producing at a level of NUM , and then VERB with increasing production to NUM , marginal NOUN from the increase in production would VERB marginal costs — and so profits would rise . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> no perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , the combination of many firms entering or VERB the market will affect overall supply in the market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for an increasing cost industry , as the market VERB , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new NUM - profit level VERB at a higher price than before . <sent_end> <sent_begin> here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to explore what is meant by ADJ efficiency , it is useful to VERB through an example . <sent_end> <sent_begin> begin by VERB that the market for ADJ flowers is perfectly competitive , and so p = PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are NUM types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other is legal monopoly , where laws VERB ( or ADV limit ) competition . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN office . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a patent gives the NOUN the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the NOUN for a limited time ; in the united states , exclusive patent rights last for NUM years . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that ADJ firms can VERB their investment in NOUN , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more ADV once the patent VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but in certain areas , like the NOUN of new NOUN , it has been ADJ whether patent or NOUN protection should apply . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is also a body of law known as trade NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> even if a company does not have a patent on an NOUN , competing firms are not allowed to VERB their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> businesses have developed a number of NOUN for creating barriers to entry by VERB potential NOUN from entering the market . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM method is known as ADJ NOUN , in which a firm uses the threat of ADJ price cuts to VERB competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is a NOUN of u.s. antitrust law , but it is difficult to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for a perfect NOUN , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but a NOUN can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a NOUN increases sales by NUM unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also VERB some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price NOUN in the face of the competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you recall , price NOUN are firms that have no market power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they simply have to take the market price as given . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN , and PROPN ’s ) , plus NUM more stores that sold women ’s NOUN NOUN ( like PROPN PROPN and PROPN ’s secret ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most of the markets that consumers VERB at the ADJ level are ADV competitive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the other type of ADV competitive market is ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ markets are those dominated by a small number of firms . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some ADJ aspects may be NOUN like a NOUN of satisfaction or money back , a NOUN for high quality , services like free NOUN , or VERB a loan to purchase the product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , product NOUN may occur in the NOUN of buyers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , many people could not VERB the difference in taste between common NOUN of NOUN or NOUN if they were VERB but , because of past NOUN and NOUN , they have strong NOUN for certain NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the process by which a ADJ NOUN makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a NOUN makes such decisions , NUM differences are worth VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , although both a NOUN and a ADJ NOUN face downward - VERB demand curves , the NOUN ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a ADJ NOUN is based on the extent of its product NOUN and how many NOUN it faces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> second , a NOUN is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a ADJ NOUN who VERB profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but ADJ , products . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , although a ADV competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to NUM in the long run . <sent_end> <sent_begin> remember that NUM economic profit is not ADJ to NUM accounting profit . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NUM economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather , they are NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> examples of NOUN NOUN and include the NOUN industry , NOUN television , and commercial air travel . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by acting together , ADJ firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a group of firms that have a formal agreement to VERB to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN smith wrote in wealth of nations in NUM : “ people of the same trade ADV meet together , even for NOUN and NOUN , but the NOUN ends in a NOUN against the public , or in some NOUN to raise prices . ” <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each NOUN , however , must VERB that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows the NOUN ’s NOUN for a NUM - firm NOUN — known as a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if firms a and b both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ NUM in profits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM example of the pressure these firms can VERB on one another is the ADJ demand curve , in which competing NOUN firms VERB to VERB price cuts , but not price increases . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this situation is shown in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a corporate NOUN occurs when NUM ADV separate firms combine to become a single firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when NUM firm purchases another , it is called an NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ NOUN , ” in which a group of ADV independent firms were VERB together by NOUN and purchases , and a group of “ NOUN ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , when the u.s. government passed the PROPN antitrust act in NUM to limit the power of these NOUN , it was called an antitrust law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in an early NOUN of the law ’s power , the u.s. supreme court in NUM upheld the government ’s right to break up standard oil , which had controlled about NUM % of the country ’s oil NOUN , into NUM independent firms , including PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN have VERB for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are VERB for by the largest firms , typically the top NUM to NUM firms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for an explanation of how high market NOUN can create NOUN in an economy , refer to monopoly . <sent_end> <sent_begin> say that the market for VERB broken NOUN NOUN in a certain city has NUM firms with the market NOUN shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s NOUN of total sales in that market . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB a market is often controversial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , PROPN in the early NOUN had a dominant share of the NOUN for computer operating systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> antitrust law includes rules against ADJ practices — practices that do not involve ADJ agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> antitrust cases involving ADJ practices are often controversial , because they VERB into specific NOUN or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . for example , if a product NOUN is selling to a group of NOUN who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the NOUN to demand a minimum NOUN price maintenance agreement , which would require the NOUN to sell for at least a certain minimum price . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB sales happen when a NOUN is required to buy NUM product only if the NOUN also VERB a second product . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> all sides agreed that the NOUN of computer NOUN that was ADJ with NOUN — both NOUN produced by PROPN and that produced by other companies — had expanded ADV in the 1990s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where NUM company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust NOUN look at any NOUN of ADJ practices with special care . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest . <sent_end> <sent_begin> point c illustrates NUM ADJ choice : the NOUN requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost VERB the demand curve at an output of NUM , and charge the price of NUM , which is equal to marginal cost at that point . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this rule is ADJ because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would VERB consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice a . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to NOUN of all political NOUN that the existing price regulation was not working well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the united states carried out a great policy experiment — the NOUN discussed in monopoly — VERB government controls over prices and quantities produced in NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , ADJ NOUN travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the clear it up VERB the outcome of NOUN in NUM industry in particular — NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what are the results of NOUN NOUN ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of the markets for these assets VERB the financial crisis and led to the failure of PROPN PROPN , a major investment bank , numerous large commercial banks , such as PROPN , and even the federal national PROPN corporation ( PROPN PROPN ) , which had to be VERB — that is , taken over by the federal government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM response to the financial crisis was the PROPN - PROPN act , which attempted major NOUN of the financial system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the legislation ’s purpose , as noted on X is : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called NOUN . externalities can be negative or positive . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you hate country music , then having it VERB into your house every night would be a negative NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> pollution is a negative NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> economists VERB the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the social costs include the private costs of production VERB by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , when the NOUN of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when there is market failure , the private market VERB to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs VERB in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the same year , the PROPN air act was VERB to address air pollution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just NUM years later , in NUM , congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching PROPN water act . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and NOUN , have been largely responsible for america ’s ADJ air and water in recent decades . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when a city or state government sets up a ADJ NOUN program ( e.g. NOUN - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it VERB to meet national pollution standards . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , it also found that a middle - range NOUN of the health and other benefits from ADJ air was $ NUM NUM — about NUM times higher than the costs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a more recent study by the PROPN estimated that the environmental benefits to americans from the PROPN air act will VERB their costs by a NOUN of NUM to NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN estimated that “ in NUM the benefits of PROPN air act programs will total about $ NUM NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the ADJ and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more ADJ methods must be used . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the marginal cost curve rises . <sent_end> <sent_begin> also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , low - income countries , with some ADJ NOUN , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to VERB them on the NOUN of VERB environmental protection ADV of economic growth . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , high - income countries have ADV been the primary NOUN to NOUN NOUN by VERB fossil NOUN — and still are today . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is hard to VERB people who are living in a low - income country , where ADJ NOUN , health care , and education are VERB , that they should VERB an VERB quality of life for a ADJ environment . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> depending on their different income levels and political NOUN , countries are likely to make different choices about ADJ efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is ADV on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in certain cases , however , competition can VERB new technology , especially when other firms can quickly VERB a new idea . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider a ADJ firm VERB to develop a new drug . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , when a firm VERB in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether VERB by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as you learned in environmental protection and negative externalities , positive externalities are beneficial NOUN to a third party , or parties . consider the example of the big drug company , which is VERB its NOUN budget for the next year . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> data in [ link ] , from the u.s. bureau of labor statistics ’ ADJ PROPN PROPN of wage and PROPN workers , third PROPN NUM , demonstrate that ADJ ADJ NOUN are higher for workers who have completed more education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while these rates of return will VERB ADJ investments in treasury bonds or savings accounts , the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker , so these returns are private rates of return to education . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first NOUN is a NOUN NOUN and it VERB the last NUM NOUN , ' less than a high school degree , ' ' high school degree , no college , ' and ' PROPN 's degree . ' <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM way to increase new technology is to VERB the NOUN an exclusive right to that new product or process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> intellectual property rights include NOUN , which give the NOUN the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the NOUN for a limited time , and NOUN laws , which give the NOUN an exclusive legal right over works of NOUN , music , NOUN / NOUN , and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if a ADJ firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can VERB or sell that drug for NUM - NUM years , unless the firm with the patent grants NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , united for medical research , a NOUN of groups that seek funding for the national PROPN of health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ PROPN - supported research added $ NUM NUM to our gdp and supported NUM NUM jobs in NUM alone . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the united states remains the leading NOUN of medical - related research spending $ NUM NUM in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> other institutions , such as the national PROPN of scientists and the national PROPN of PROPN , receive federal grants for ADJ projects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN and food research PROPN ( PROPN ) at the united states department of PROPN VERB federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> instead , public goods have NUM VERB characteristics : they are ADJ and ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first characteristic , that a public good is ADJ , means that it is ADJ or impossible to VERB someone from using the good . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if PROPN VERB a private good like a piece of NOUN , then he can VERB others , like PROPN , from eating that NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some of these are NOUN cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM example of a NOUN depth NOUN is NOUN NOUN , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to experience this slightly different view , do this simple exercise : extend your NOUN fully and extend NUM of your NOUN and focus on that NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the place theory of NOUN perception suggests that different portions of the ADJ membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> more specifically , the base of the ADJ membrane VERB best to high frequencies and the NOUN of the ADJ membrane VERB best to low frequencies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if a sound comes from an off - center location , it creates NUM types of ADJ cues : NOUN level differences and NOUN NOUN differences . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more ADJ at your right ear than at your left ear because of the NOUN of the sound wave as it passes through your head . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave VERB at each ear ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the partial or complete inability to hear . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some people are born NOUN , which is known as ADJ NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many others begin to VERB from ADJ hearing loss because of age , genetic NOUN , or environmental effects , including exposure to extreme NOUN ( NOUN - induced hearing loss , as shown in [ link ] ) , certain NOUN ( such as NOUN or NOUN ) , or damage due to NOUN ( such as those found in certain NOUN and NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when the hearing problem is associated with a failure to VERB ADJ signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called ADJ hearing loss . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM disease that results in ADJ hearing loss is PROPN 's disease . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although not well understood , PROPN 's disease results in a NOUN of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , NOUN ( constant NOUN or NOUN ) , PROPN ( a sense of NOUN ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states and other places around the world , ADJ people have their own language , schools , and customs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called ADJ culture . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the united states , ADJ individuals often communicate using american sign language ( PROPN ) ; PROPN has no ADJ component and is based entirely on visual NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is our fifth taste . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is actually a japanese word that roughly VERB to ADJ , and it is associated with a taste for NOUN NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is also a growing body of experimental evidence VERB that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> small hair - like NOUN from these receptors serve as the sites for NOUN molecules VERB in the NOUN to interact with chemical receptors located on these NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once an NOUN molecule has bound a given receptor , chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory NOUN : a NOUN - like structure at the NOUN of the frontal lobe where the olfactory NOUN begin . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from the olfactory NOUN , information is sent to regions of the ADJ system and to the primary olfactory cortex , which is located very near the ADJ cortex ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN respond to pressure and lower frequency NOUN , and ADJ NOUN detect ADJ pressure and higher frequency NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s NOUN respond to light pressure , while PROPN NOUN detect NOUN ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each ADJ to specific NOUN - related stimuli . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as a result , pain signals that are sent to the brain get ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this type of pain is known as ADJ pain . <sent_end> <sent_begin> multiple treatment NOUN for pain relief range from relaxation therapy to the use of ADJ NOUN to deep brain NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the law of NOUN suggests that we are more likely to VERB continuous , smooth VERB lines rather than ADJ , broken lines ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the principle of NOUN states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this chapter , you have learned that perception is a complex process . <sent_end> <sent_begin> built from NOUN , but influenced by our own experiences , NOUN , NOUN , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research suggests that ADJ racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> does the name PROPN PROPN ring a bell ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> even if you are new to the study of psychology , NOUN are that you have heard of PROPN and his famous dogs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in PROPN ’s experiments , the dogs VERB each time NOUN NOUN was presented to them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN in this situation was an ADJ stimulus ( PROPN ) : a stimulus that VERB a ADJ response in an organism . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the dogs ’ NOUN was an ADJ response ( PROPN ) : a natural ( ADJ ) reaction to a given stimulus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when you finally VERB it fixed and started using it to open PROPN ’s food again , PROPN would remember the association between the can NOUN and her food — she would get excited and run to the NOUN when she heard the sound . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the behavior of PROPN ’s dogs and PROPN illustrates a concept PROPN called ADJ recovery : the return of a previously VERB conditioned response following a rest period ( [ PROPN is the curve of NOUN , extinction , and ADJ recovery . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated NOUN of the conditioned stimulus and the ADJ stimulus ( NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but if you do not VERB her following the electric NOUN sound , and you continue to VERB her ADV after the electric can NOUN sound , she will quickly learn to VERB between the NUM sounds ( provided they are ADV ADJ that she can VERB them DET , classical conditioning can lead to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented ADV without change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the stimulus occurs over and over , we learn not to focus our attention on it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> psychologist b. f. skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are ADV VERB , and it does n’t account for new behaviors such as VERB a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the most effective way to VERB a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in positive reinforcement , a ADJ stimulus is added to increase a behavior . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in positive punishment , you add an ADJ stimulus to decrease a behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example of positive punishment is VERB a student to get the student to stop VERB in class . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how about PROPN , the NOUN NOUN ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> if you gave PROPN a piece of NOUN every time he made a goal , you would be using a primary NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> primary NOUN are NOUN that have innate VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> VERB this NOUN NOUN where NOUN PROPN PROPN PROPN shapes a NOUN ’s behavior using the steps VERB above . once a behavior is VERB , researchers and NOUN often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule — partial reinforcement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in partial reinforcement , also referred to as ADJ reinforcement , the person or animal does not get VERB every time they perform the VERB behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are several different types of partial reinforcement NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB NOUN at an NOUN store , and she VERB a commission every time she VERB a pair of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> he also studied a NOUN group that was VERB with food at the end of the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the ADJ NOUN VERB the NOUN , they developed a cognitive map : a mental picture of the NOUN of the NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after NUM NOUN in the NOUN without reinforcement , food was placed in a goal NOUN at the end of the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ learning , we learn by VERB others and then VERB , or NOUN , what they do or say . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the individuals VERB the VERB behavior are called models . <sent_end> <sent_begin> research suggests that this ADJ learning involves a specific type of neuron , called a NOUN neuron ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if you saw that the model was VERB for her behavior , you will be more motivated to VERB her . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is known as ADJ reinforcement . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the other hand , if you observed the model being VERB , you would be less motivated to VERB her . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is only NUM NOUN of the complex processes involved in NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> simply put , NOUN is thinking , and it VERB the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , NOUN , language , and memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> scientists who study NOUN are VERB for ways to understand how we VERB , organize , and VERB our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our NOUN are doing ( for example , PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another technique used by your brain to organize information is the NOUN of NOUN for the concepts you have developed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is the best example or representation of a concept . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , for the category of civil NOUN , your NOUN could be PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a mental NOUN consisting of a NOUN or collection of related concepts ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are many different types of NOUN , and they all have NUM NOUN in common : NOUN are a method of VERB information that allows the brain to work more ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to VERB information from NUM individual to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while language is a form of communication , not all communication is language . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> words are formed by VERB the various NOUN that make up the language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN ( e.g. , the sounds “ INTJ ” ADP “ INTJ ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different NOUN have different sets of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are combined to form NOUN , which are the ADJ units of language that VERB some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ i ” is both a NOUN and a NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN refers to the process by which we VERB meaning from NOUN and words . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN refers to the way words are organized into NOUN ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even the NOUN that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is sometimes seen in the form of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this context , NOUN refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another type of strategy is an NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an NOUN is a problem - solving formula that provides you with step - by - step NOUN used to achieve a VERB outcome ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> you can think of an NOUN as a NOUN with highly detailed NOUN that produce the same result every time they are performed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the person is ADJ — but she just needs to go to another NOUN , instead of trying to get out through the VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a mental set is where you VERB in VERB a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an VERB bias occurs when you focus on NUM piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this case , you VERB so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . the NOUN bias is the tendency to focus on information that VERB your existing beliefs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , if you think that your NOUN is not very ADJ , you VERB all of the instances of ADJ behavior VERB by the NOUN while VERB the ADJ ADJ interactions he is involved in on a daily basis . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , the NOUN NOUN is a NOUN in which you make a decision based on an example , information , or recent experience that is that ADV available to you , even though it may not be the best example to VERB your decision . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN tend to “ preserve that which is already established — to maintain our VERB knowledge , beliefs , attitudes , and NOUN ” ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN are VERB in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , drive theory also VERB the role that NOUN play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once we have VERB in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive , we are more likely to engage in that behavior ADV faced with that drive in the future ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ intelligence is closely aligned with ADJ problem solving and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN says that ADJ intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to VERB , VERB , judge , compare , and contrast . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s ADJ and ADJ NOUN are often combined into a single type : emotional intelligence . <sent_end> <sent_begin> emotional intelligence VERB the ability to understand the emotions of PRON and others , show NOUN , understand social relationships and cues , and regulate your own emotions and respond in ADV appropriate ways ( PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people with high emotional intelligence typically have well - developed social skills . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as blood glucose levels increase , the pancreas and liver VERB signals to VERB off NOUN and eating ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , small , & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the food ’s passage through the ADJ NOUN also provides important NOUN signals to the brain ( PROPN , NUM ) , and fat cells release NOUN , a NOUN hormone . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this observation led some to VERB a set - point theory of body weight regulation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the set - point theory VERB that each individual has an ideal body weight , or set point , which is ADJ to change . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this set - point is ADV VERB and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set - point are VERB by ADJ changes in energy NOUN and/or expenditure ( PROPN et al . , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people who are so ADJ that they are at risk for death are classified as ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN is defined as having a PROPN over NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> note that although PROPN has been used as a healthy weight NOUN by the world health organization ( who ) , the PROPN , and other groups , its value as an NOUN tool has been VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> people VERB from NOUN VERB engage in NOUN eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to VERB for the large amount of food VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB the food by VERB NOUN or through the use of NOUN are NUM common ADJ behaviors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN NOUN is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through NOUN and/or excessive exercise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> individuals VERB from NOUN NOUN often have a ADJ body image , VERB in NOUN as a type of body NOUN , meaning that they view themselves as ADJ even though they are not . <sent_end> <sent_begin> like NOUN ADV , NOUN NOUN is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes : bone loss , heart failure , kidney failure , NOUN ( NOUN of the ADJ period ) , reduced function of the NOUN , and in extreme cases , death . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN and johnson ’s NOUN NUM , william PROPN and virginia johnson published a book VERB the results of their observations of nearly NUM people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior . <sent_end> <sent_begin> unlike PROPN , who used personal NOUN and NOUN to VERB data , PROPN and johnson observed people having NOUN in a variety of positions , and they observed people VERB , ADV or with the aid of a device . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by NOUN of the NOUN or NOUN and NOUN and expansion of the ADJ canal . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during NOUN , women experience further NOUN of the NOUN and increased blood flow to the NOUN NOUN , and men experience full NOUN and often exhibit pre - ADJ fluid . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while many women can quickly VERB the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer ADJ period as part of resolution . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ period is a period of time that follows an NOUN during which an individual is ADJ of VERB another NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in men , the NOUN of the ADJ period can vary ADV from individual to individual with some ADJ periods as short as several NOUN and others as long as a day . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this involves VERB in opposite - sex NOUN and VERB an opposite - sex identity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these individuals may also VERB NOUN hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex , and in some cases , they elect to have NOUN to alter the appearance of their external NOUN to VERB that of their gender identity ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while these may sound like ADJ changes , gender ADJ individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a NOUN of nature , and they seek to correct this NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN means that the manner of administration , VERB , and interpretation of results is consistent . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected VERB groups , such as age groups . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the resulting data provide norms , or ADJ NOUN , by which to VERB future NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the average NOUN NOUN on an NOUN test is NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> standard NOUN describe how data are VERB in a population and give context to large data sets . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bell curve uses the standard NOUN to show how all NOUN are VERB from the average NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> range of reaction is the theory that each person VERB to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to this idea , your genetic potential is a fixed quantity , but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental NOUN you experience , especially in childhood . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as we move through our daily lives , we experience a variety of emotions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an emotion is a ADJ state of being that we often describe as our feelings . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the words emotion and mood are sometimes used ADV , but psychologists use these words to refer to NUM different things . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the assumption is that most of us would show NOUN of physiological arousal if we were being ADJ with someone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN , or VERB NOUN test , measures the physiological arousal of an individual VERB to a series of questions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> someone VERB in reading these tests would look for NOUN to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential NOUN that the NOUN may have been ADJ on those NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ NOUN has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions , especially fear and anxiety ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , PROPN , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is composed of various NOUN , including the ADJ complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> or does being ADJ make you VERB ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> the facial feedback hypothesis VERB that facial NOUN are capable of VERB our emotions , meaning that NOUN can make you feel ADJ ( PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , martin , & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recent research VERB how PROPN , which VERB facial muscles and limits facial expression , might affect emotion . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN VERB that personality traits and human behaviors are based on NUM separate NOUN associated with NUM fluids ( “ NOUN ” ) of the body : ADJ NOUN ( yellow NOUN from the liver ) , ADJ NOUN ( black NOUN from the kidneys ) , ADJ NOUN ( red blood from the heart ) , and ADJ NOUN ( white NOUN from the lungs ) ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> centuries later , the ADJ greek NOUN and NOUN PROPN built on PROPN ’s theory , VERB that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by NOUN in the NOUN and that each person VERB NUM of the NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the ADJ person is ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ ; the ADJ person is VERB , ADJ , and ADJ ; the ADJ person is ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ ; and the ADJ person is ADJ , ADJ , and ADJ ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ; PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when certain events , feelings , or NOUN cause an individual anxiety , the individual VERB to reduce that anxiety . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to do that , the individual ’s unconscious mind uses NOUN defense mechanisms , unconscious ADJ behaviors that VERB to reduce anxiety . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , usually conscious , NOUN to unconscious NOUN to protect the NOUN from being VERB by anxiety . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in each ADJ stage of development , the child ’s NOUN - seeking NOUN , coming from the i d , are focused on a different area of the body , called an ADJ zone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the stages are ADJ , ADJ , ADJ , NOUN , and ADJ ( [ ADV ’s ADJ development theory is quite controversial . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> freud ’s third stage of ADJ development is the ADJ stage ( NUM years ) , VERB to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ zone in this stage is the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN , a NOUN of freud ’s and the first president of the PROPN PROPN society ( freud ’s inner NOUN of NOUN ) , was the first major NOUN to break away from freud ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> he ADV founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to VERB for feelings of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as an art school NOUN with an ADJ future , young PROPN PROPN met freud ’s daughter , PROPN freud , while he was VERB the children of an american NOUN VERB NOUN in PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it was PROPN freud who encouraged PROPN to study NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory NOUN , which are common to all of us ( PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADJ memories , which PROPN called NOUN , are represented by universal NOUN in various cultures , as expressed through NOUN , art , and dreams ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN said that these NOUN reflect common experiences of people the world over , such as VERB death , becoming independent , and VERB for NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we get information into our NOUN through a process called NOUN , which is the input of information into the memory system . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once we receive sensory information from the environment , our NOUN VERB or code it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> our NOUN take the VERB information and place it in storage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> storage is the creation of a permanent record of information . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through NUM distinct stages : sensory memory , short - term memory , and finally long - term memory . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( note : sometimes , but not always , the terms explicit memory and ADJ memory are used ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ) ADJ memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness . <sent_end> <sent_begin> they are memories formed from behaviors . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADJ means having to do with language and knowledge about language . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an example would be the question “ what does ADJ mean ? ” stored in our ADJ memory is knowledge about words , concepts , and language - based knowledge and facts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , VERB to the following questions are stored in your ADJ memory : <sent_end>
<sent_begin> very few people can recall events in this way ; right now , only NUM known individuals have this ability , and only a few have been studied ( PROPN , PROPN & PROPN NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and although PROPN normally appears in NOUN , NUM children in the united states appear to have memories from well before their ADJ NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , you would use recall for an NOUN test . <sent_end> <sent_begin> recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after VERB it again . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it involves a process of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although the NOUN seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories , you could still lose it and be able to create ADJ memories ( ADJ memory , motor learning , and classical conditioning ) , NOUN to your NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , NUM classical conditioning experiment is to VERB subjects to VERB when they are given a NOUN of air . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN ( NUM ) proposed the concept of NOUN of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development . <sent_end> <sent_begin> distinct from self - NOUN , which involves our belief in our own NOUN , NOUN of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN is the loss of long - term memory that occurs as the result of disease , physical NOUN , or psychological NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> psychologist PROPN ( NUM ) and his NOUN at the university of PROPN studied PROPN PROPN for years . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of new memories is sometimes called construction , and the process of VERB up old memories is called reconstruction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> yet as we VERB our memories , we also tend to alter and VERB them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> contrast the cotton case with what VERB in the elizabeth PROPN case . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when elizabeth was NUM years old and ADV ADJ in her NOUN at home , she was VERB at PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> “ i VERB a ADJ memory for VERB , ” VERB robert PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB refers to loss of information from long - term memory . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we all VERB things , like a VERB one ’s NOUN , someone ’s name , or where we put our car NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> you probably VERB INTJ to at least NUM , if not all , of these examples — but do n’t VERB , you are not alone . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we are all ADJ to VERB the memory error known as NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN in memory are caused by NOUN in attention or our focus being ADV else . PROPN , a psychologist , VERB a time when she recently committed the memory error of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> how about a memory of a ADJ event , something you really do not want to think about ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> when you keep VERB something , to the point where you VERB n’t “ get it out of your head ” and it VERB with your ability to VERB on other things , it is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it ’s PROPN ’s ADJ and last memory error . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the “ third force ” in psychology , NOUN is VERB as a reaction both to the ADJ NOUN of NOUN , with its emphasis on psychological disturbance , and to the NOUN ’ view of humans ADV VERB to the environment , which has been VERB as making people out to be personality - less NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it does not suggest that ADJ , NOUN , and other points of view are ADJ but VERB that these NOUN do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience , and VERB to recognize the innate capacity for self - VERB change and VERB personal experiences . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rogers further divided the self into NUM categories : the ideal self and the real self . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ideal self is the person that you would like to be ; the real self is the person you actually are . <sent_end> <sent_begin> rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve NOUN between these NUM NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what are some everyday ways we can improve our memory , including recall ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> to help make sure information goes from short - term memory to long - term memory , you can use memory - VERB strategies . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM strategy is NOUN , or the conscious NOUN of information to be VERB ( PROPN & PROPN , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> through the work of scientists in the late ADJ century , the main features of the ADJ force — the existence of NUM types of charge , the observation that like charges VERB , unlike charges attract , and the decrease of force with distance — were eventually VERB , and expressed as a ADJ formula . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ formula for the ADJ force is called PROPN ’s law after the french NOUN charles PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) , who performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , a charged NOUN NOUN VERB neutral NOUN of paper from a distance via the PROPN force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is very useful to think of an object being surrounded in space by a force field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the force field carries the force to another object ( called a test object ) some distance away . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we VERB that there is a positive test charge , NOUN size NUM { q } { } , at point INTJ , which allows us to determine the direction of the fields PROPN NOUN size NUM { e rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } and PROPN PROPN size NUM { e rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> once those fields are found , the total field can be determined using vector addition . solution <sent_end>
<sent_begin> its NUM electrons ( NUM from the oxygen atom and NUM from the NUM hydrogen atoms ) tend to remain ADV to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this creates NUM centers of equal and opposite charges — what is called a NOUN , as illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the magnitude of the NOUN is called the NOUN moment . these NUM centers of charge will VERB some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge , as on a dna molecule . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN contain free charges that move easily . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when excess charge is placed on a conductor or the conductor is put into a ADJ electric field , charges in the conductor quickly respond to reach a ADJ state called ADJ equilibrium . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another device that makes use of some of these principles is a PROPN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is a NOUN NOUN that VERB a volume . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the study of NOUN has VERB useful in many areas . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN covers just a few of the many NOUN of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the heart of the process is shown in VERB form in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN - VERB NOUN NOUN is VERB with positive charge from points on a device called a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a substance with an interesting property — it is a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> that is , NOUN is an NOUN when in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN NOUN , commonly used to VERB computer - generated NOUN and NOUN , also VERB NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN makes a ADJ NOUN of ADJ NOUN NOUN , which are then given an ADJ charge . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this implies that a conductor is an ADJ surface in ADJ situations . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there can be no voltage difference across the surface of a conductor , or charges will flow . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the uses of this fact is that a conductor can be fixed at NUM NOUN by VERB it to the earth with a good conductor — a process called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN can be a useful safety tool . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ( recall that e = v / de = v / d size NUM { e = v / d } { } for a parallel NOUN NOUN . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> also shown in [ link ] are maximum electric field NOUN in v / m , called NOUN NOUN , for several materials . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these are the fields above which the material begins to break down and conduct . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s law ( like PROPN ’s law ) is not ADV ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the many substances for which PROPN ’s law holds are called ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these include good NOUN like NOUN and NOUN , and some poor NOUN under certain circumstances . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> most well - known NOUN , however , use a time - varying voltage source . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB current ( PROPN ) is the flow of electric charge that ADV VERB direction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the source varies ADV , particularly ADV , the circuit is known as an VERB current circuit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a thermal NOUN is NUM where excessive electric power causes ADJ thermal effects , such as starting a fire in the wall of a house . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN occurs when electric current passes through a person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN range in NOUN from ADJ , but otherwise ADJ , to heart - VERB NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ number of nerve cells and the ADV greater number of connections between them makes this system the ADJ NOUN that it is . <sent_end> <sent_begin> nerve NOUN is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it is NUM aspect of NOUN , or electrical effects in and created by biological systems . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN ( PROPN ) is a record of the NOUN created by the wave of NOUN and subsequent NOUN in the heart . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN between pairs of NOUN placed on the NOUN are vector components of the voltage wave on the heart . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> when are NOUN in series ? <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are in series ADV the flow of charge , called the current , must flow through NOUN ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the reason for the decrease in output voltage for ADJ or VERB NOUN is that all voltage sources have NUM fundamental parts — a source of electrical energy and an internal resistance . <sent_end> <sent_begin> let us VERB both . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> PROPN ’s second rule ( the loop rule ) is an application of conservation of energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the loop rule is stated in terms of potential , PROPN size NUM { v } { } , rather than potential energy , but the NUM are related since PROPN NOUN = q NOUN NOUN = PUNCT size NUM { ital " PROPN " rsub { size NUM { " NOUN " } } = ital " PUNCT " } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a ADJ measurement device for measuring NOUN ( NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if ADV VERB , NUM pole will point toward the north . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM NOUN are thus named the north magnetic pole and the south magnetic pole ( or more ADV , north - seeking and south - seeking NOUN , for the NOUN in those directions ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> what happens on a ADJ scale is illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the regions within the material called NOUN act like small bar NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> within NOUN , the NOUN of individual atoms are aligned . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN is the use of electric current to make NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these ADV induced NOUN are called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are employed for everything from a VERB NOUN NOUN that VERB VERB cars to VERB the NOUN of a NUM - NOUN particle NOUN to the NOUN in medical NOUN NOUN ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN for magnetic NOUN NOUN ( PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this separation of charge creates a voltage ADP size NUM { NOUN } { } , known as the PROPN emf , across the conductor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the creation of a voltage across a current - carrying conductor by a magnetic field is known as the PROPN effect , after PROPN PROPN , the american NOUN who discovered it in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN effect . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) electrons move to the left in this flat conductor ( ADJ current to the right ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the field around a long straight NOUN is found to be in circular NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the right hand rule NUM ( NOUN ) VERB from this NOUN and is ADJ for any current segment — point the NOUN in the direction of the current , and the NOUN VERB in the direction of the magnetic field NOUN created by it . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( a ) NOUN placed near a long straight current - carrying NOUN indicate that field lines form circular NOUN VERB on the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( b ) right hand rule NUM states that , if the right hand NOUN points in the direction of the current , the NOUN VERB in the direction of the field . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> integral NOUN is needed to sum the field for an ADJ shape current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this results in a more complete law , called PROPN ’s law , which VERB magnetic field and current in a general way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN ’s law in turn is a part of PROPN ’s NOUN , which give a complete theory of all electromagnetic phenomena . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a NOUN is a long NOUN of NOUN ( with many NOUN or NOUN , as opposed to a flat loop ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of its shape , the field inside a NOUN can be very ADJ , and also very strong . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it non - ADV produces NUM - dimensional and NUM - dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with NOUN of the NOUN of x - rays . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is based on an effect called nuclear magnetic NOUN ( PROPN ) in which an ADV applied magnetic field VERB with the nuclei of certain atoms , particularly those of hydrogen ( protons ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these nuclei possess their own small magnetic fields , similar to those of electrons and the current NOUN discussed earlier in this chapter . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when placed in an external magnetic field , such nuclei experience a NOUN that VERB or VERB the nuclei into NUM of NUM new energy states — depending on the orientation of its NOUN ( ADJ to the n pole and s pole in a bar NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this relationship is known as PROPN ’s law of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the units for emf are NOUN , as is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as discussed in PROPN emf , PROPN emf is induced when a conductor moves in a magnetic field or when a magnetic field moves relative to a conductor . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if PROPN emf can cause a current loop in the conductor , we refer to that current as an NOUN current . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN NOUN can produce significant NOUN , called magnetic NOUN , on the motion involved . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> note that the frequency of the NOUN is f = NUM / NUM NOUN f = NUM / NUM NUM size NUM { f = NUM / NUM NUM } { } , and the period is t = NUM / f = NUM NOUN / NOUN t = NUM / f = NUM NUM / NUM size NUM { t = NUM / f = NUM NOUN / NUM } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> [ link ] shows a graph of emf as a function of time , and it now seems ADJ that NOUN voltage is ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is known as the NOUN equation , and it simply states that the ratio of the secondary to primary NOUN in a NOUN VERB the ratio of the number of NOUN in their NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a thermal NOUN occurs when there is electrical VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a NOUN NOUN occurs when electric current passes through a person . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both NOUN have already been discussed . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of a ADJ NOUN , the ADJ NOUN of NOUN , the NOUN of NOUN , the x - ray VERB a broken bone , even NOUN NOUN — all are brought to us by electromagnetic waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the list of the various types of electromagnetic waves , VERB from radio transmission waves to nuclear NOUN - ray ( ADP size NUM } { } X ) NOUN , is interesting in itself . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> electric field lines VERB on positive charges and VERB on negative charges . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the electric field is defined as the force per unit charge on a test charge , and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant NOUN size NUM { NOUN rsub { size NUM { NUM } } } { } , also known as the NOUN of free space . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> as the process continues , the charge separation VERB and the field VERB its maximum downward value , returns to NUM , and rises to its maximum upward value at the end of NUM complete cycle . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the ADJ wave has an amplitude proportional to the maximum separation of charge . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its wavelength λ λ size NUM { left ( λ right ) } { } is proportional to the period of the NOUN and , hence , is smaller for short periods or high frequencies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of the NOUN are critical for determining the frequency of the ADJ electromagnetic waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is a ADJ phenomenon and when we VERB NOUN or NOUN , we vary electrical properties to achieve appropriate ADJ conditions in the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN radio waves are used to carry commercial radio signals in the frequency range from NUM to NUM NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN NOUN VERB for amplitude NOUN , which is the method for VERB information on these waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( see [ link ] . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> television is also VERB on electromagnetic waves . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since the waves must carry a great deal of visual as well as ADJ information , each NOUN requires a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are the highest - frequency electromagnetic waves that can be produced by NOUN in ADJ NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN frequencies range from about NUM hz NUM hz size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { NUM } } ` " hz " } { } to the highest practical PROPN size NUM { ital " PROPN " } { } NOUN at nearly NUM hz NUM hz size NUM { " NUM " rsup { size NUM { " NUM " } } ` " hz " } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN and ADJ regions of the electromagnetic spectrum NOUN ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ radiation is generally produced by thermal motion and the NOUN and rotation of atoms and molecules . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ NOUN in atoms and molecules can also produce ADJ radiation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is true ADV the VERB surfaces are ADJ , and it is independent of the angle of NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such an object , shown in [ link ] , is called a NOUN NOUN , since the light VERB from its inside NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many ADJ NOUN NOUN on NOUN , cars , and NOUN NOUN have NOUN NOUN designed to return light in the direction from which it VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> due to the lens ’s shape , light is thus ADJ toward the axis at both surfaces . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the point at which the rays cross is defined to be the ADJ point f of the lens . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the distance from the center of the lens to its ADJ point is defined to be the ADJ PROPN size NUM { f } { } of the lens . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while ray VERB for ADJ NOUN , such as those found in ADJ NOUN , may require computer techniques , there is a set of simple rules for VERB rays through thin NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a thin lens is defined to be NUM whose NOUN allows rays to VERB , as illustrated in [ link ] , but does not allow properties such as NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an ideal thin lens has NUM VERB surfaces but the lens is thin enough to VERB that light rays VERB only once . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the eye VERB this by varying the power ( and ADJ length ) of the lens to VERB for objects at various NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process of VERB the eye ’s ADJ length is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person with normal ( ideal ) vision can see objects clearly at NOUN VERB from NUM NOUN to essentially NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> more ADJ rays from a close object are VERB on the retina for a clear image . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the distance to the ADJ object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye ( normally NOUN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN , or NOUN , is the inability to see close objects clearly while ADJ objects may be clear . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another common vision NOUN is NOUN , an NOUN or NOUN in the focus of the eye . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , rays passing through a vertical region of the eye may focus ADV than rays passing through a horizontal region , resulting in the image VERB ADJ . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this is true to an extent , but we find that color perception is even ADJ than our eye ’s response for various NOUN of light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NUM major types of light - NOUN cells ( NOUN ) in the retina are NOUN and cones . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN are more sensitive than cones by a factor of about NUM and are solely responsible for peripheral vision as well as vision in very dark environments . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM theory that takes various factors into account was VERB by PROPN land ( NUM – NUM ) , the ADJ NOUN of the PROPN corporation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> land proposed , based ADV on his many ADJ experiments , that the NUM types of cones are organized into systems called PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each NOUN forms an image that is compared with the others , and the eye - brain system thus can compare a NOUN - VERB white NOUN NOUN with its generally ADJ NOUN and determine that it is actually white . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> if we pass light through smaller NOUN , often called NOUN , we can use PROPN ’s principle to see that light NOUN as sound does ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a wave around the NOUN of an opening or an NOUN is called NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN is a wave characteristic and occurs for all types of waves . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM , PUNCT ( ADJ ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> size NUM { d ` " NOUN " NOUN = NOUN , ` m = NUM , ` NUM , ` X , ` NUM , ` PUNCT , ` PROPN } { } similarly , to obtain ADJ interference for a double NOUN , the path length difference must be a half - integral multiple of the wavelength , or <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ NOUN are those that VERB ADV . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this interference is between light VERB from different surfaces of a thin NOUN ; thus , the effect is known as thin NOUN interference . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as VERB before , interference effects are most prominent when light VERB with something having a size similar to its wavelength . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> waves having such a direction are said to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for an PROPN wave , we define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus we can think of the electric field NOUN as showing the direction of polarization , as in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> an PROPN wave , such as light , is a ADJ wave . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the sun and many other light sources produce waves that are ADV VERB ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such light is said to be ADJ because it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarization . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN materials , VERB by the NOUN of PROPN corporation , PROPN land , act as a ADJ NOUN for light , allowing only polarization in NUM direction to pass through . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another interesting phenomenon associated with ADJ light is the ability of some NOUN to split an ADJ NOUN of light into NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such NOUN are said to be ADJ ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> each of the separated rays has a specific polarization . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an ADJ frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless VERB on by an outside force . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> it was not until NUM , when einstein published his first paper on special relativity , that the ADV accepted NOUN was reached . <sent_end> <sent_begin> based mostly on his analysis that the laws of NOUN and NOUN would not allow another speed for light , and only slightly aware of the PROPN - PROPN experiment , einstein detailed his second NOUN of special relativity . <sent_end> <sent_begin> second PROPN of special relativity <sent_end>
<sent_begin> an NOUN of electromagnetic radiation VERB ADJ PROPN effects if the source of the radiation is moving relative to the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the wavelength of the radiation is longer ( called a red shift ) than that VERB by the source when the source moves away from the NOUN and shorter ( called a blue shift ) when the source moves toward the NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the type of gas and its temperature , for example , could be determined . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we now know that these PROPN NOUN come from electrons VERB between energy levels in individual atoms and molecules ; thus , they are called atomic PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> atomic PROPN remain an important ADJ tool today . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they are ADJ to lines in atomic NOUN , VERB the energy levels of atoms are VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> phenomena such as ADJ atomic NOUN and characteristic x rays are VERB further in atomic physics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ radiation ( approximately NUM NOUN to NUM NOUN ) VERB with the low end of the energy range of x rays , but NOUN is typically lower in energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN comes from the de - NOUN of atoms that may be part of a ADJ solid or gas . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> not all molecules have this property . <sent_end> <sent_begin> air , for example , is nearly ADJ to many PROPN frequencies . NOUN are the highest frequencies that can be produced by ADJ NOUN , although they are also produced naturally . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus NOUN are similar to PROPN but do not extend to as high frequencies . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> λ = PROPN ( matter and NOUN ) , λ = NOUN ( matter and NOUN ) , size NUM { λ = { { h } over { p } } } { } where h h size NUM { h } { } is PROPN ’s constant and p p size NUM { p } { } is momentum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is defined to be the de PROPN wavelength . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( note that we already have this for NOUN , from the equation p = h / λ p = h / λ size NUM { p = h / λ } { } . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> particle - wave NOUN — the fact that all particles have wave properties — is NUM of the NOUN of quantum NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we first came across it in the treatment of NOUN , those particles of PROPN radiation that exhibit both particle and wave properties , but not at the same time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the english scientist william PROPN , among others , continued to study what for some time were called PROPN tubes , ADV electrons are freed from atoms and molecules in the ADJ gas inside the tube and are VERB from the NOUN ( negative ) to the NOUN ( positive ) by the high potential . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these “ NOUN rays ” VERB with the gas atoms and molecules and VERB them , resulting in the emission of electromagnetic ( PROPN ) radiation that makes the electrons ’ path visible as a ray that VERB and VERB as it moves away from the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> gas NOUN tubes today are most commonly called NOUN - ray tubes , because the rays VERB at the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN VERB that the electrons carry momentum ( they can make a small NOUN NOUN NOUN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> hydrogen spectrum wavelength . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN series requires that n f = NUM n f = NUM size NUM { n rsub { size NUM { f } } = NUM } { } . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so , if a nucleus has z z size NUM { z } { } protons ( z = NUM z = NUM size NUM { z = NUM } { } for hydrogen , NUM for NOUN , X . ) <sent_end> <sent_begin> and only NUM electron , that atom is called a hydrogen - like atom . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of hydrogen - like ions are similar to hydrogen , but VERB to higher energy by the greater ADJ force between the electron and nucleus . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> each type of atom ( or element ) has its own characteristic electromagnetic spectrum . <sent_end> <sent_begin> x rays VERB at the high - frequency end of an atom ’s spectrum and are characteristic of the atom as well . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this section , we explore characteristic x rays and some of their important NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we have previously discussed x rays as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum in photon PROPN and the electromagnetic spectrum . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> once it is excited , the atom can de - VERB in several ways , NUM of which is to re - VERB a photon of the same energy as excited it , a single step back to the ground state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this is called atomic de - NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> all other NOUN of de - NOUN involve smaller steps , in which lower - energy ( longer wavelength ) NOUN are VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> although these level NOUN are short in human terms , they are many NOUN of magnitude longer than is typical and , thus , are said to be ADJ , meaning relatively stable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN is the de - NOUN of a ADJ state . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB - in - the - dark materials , such as ADJ NOUN on some NOUN and NOUN and on children ’s NOUN and NOUN , are made of ADJ substances . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the name NOUN is an NOUN for light NOUN by stimulated emission of radiation , the process just described . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the process was proposed and developed following the NOUN in quantum physics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in order to explore the NOUN of atoms ( and VERB that magnetic fields affect moving charges ) , the ADJ NOUN PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) suggested that his student PROPN PROPN ( NUM – NUM ) study how NOUN might be affected by magnetic fields . <sent_end> <sent_begin> what they found became known as the PROPN effect , which involved ADJ lines being split into NUM or more separate emission lines by an external magnetic field , as shown in [ link ] . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for their NOUN , PROPN and PROPN shared the NUM PROPN PROPN in physics . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> physical characteristics that are VERB — such as energy , charge , and ADJ momentum — are of such importance that names and NOUN are given to them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the values of ADJ NOUN are expressed in terms of quantum numbers , and the rules VERB them are of the ADJ importance in determining what nature is and does . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this section covers some of the more important quantum numbers and rules — all of which apply in NOUN , material science , and far beyond the realm of atomic physics , where they were first discovered . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the emission of these rays is called nuclear NOUN or simply NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the rays themselves are called nuclear radiation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a nucleus that ADV VERB part of its mass to VERB radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> apart from NUM size NUM } { } , β β size NUM { β } { } , and NOUN NUM size NUM { NOUN } { } , there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well , and these also produce NOUN with similar effects . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we define VERB radiation as any form of radiation that produces NOUN whether nuclear in origin or not , since the effects and NOUN of the radiation are related to NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these NOUN ( literally , NOUN NOUN ) are personal radiation NOUN that detect the amount of radiation by the NOUN of a ADJ internal NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the amount of NOUN is related to the amount of VERB radiation VERB , a measurement of NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the energy of the radiation is sufficient to VERB atoms in a material that may VERB , such as the NOUN used by PROPN ’s group . <sent_end> <sent_begin> materials called NOUN use a more complex NOUN process to convert radiation energy into light . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN may be liquid or solid , and they can be very efficient . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei . <sent_end> <sent_begin> however , there are actually NUM types of particles in the nuclei — the NOUN and the NOUN , referred to collectively as NOUN , the constituents of nuclei . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> decay NOUN of NOUN out of the region of stability ADV produce NOUN ADV to the region of stability . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there are more stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons , called ADJ numbers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which closed NOUN are more stable . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> there are actually NUM types of NOUN decay . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first discovered was “ ordinary ” NOUN decay and is called PROPN PROPN size NUM { β rsup { size NUM { - { } } } } { } decay or electron emission . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NOUN are the NOUN NOUN to electrons , being nearly identical , having the same mass , NOUN , and so on , but having a positive charge and an electron family number of – NUM – NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when a NOUN VERB an electron , there is a ADJ NOUN in which all the mass of the ADJ - electron pair is converted into ADJ photon energy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( the reaction , e + + e NOUN SYM NOUN + NOUN e + + e NOUN SYM NOUN + NUM size NUM { e rsup { size NUM { + { } } } + e rsup { size NUM { - { } } } PROPN g + g } { } , VERB electron family number as well as all other VERB quantities . ) <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this reduces it to n / NUM n / NUM size NUM { { NUM } NOUN { " NUM " } } { } . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for an ADJ time , not just a multiple of the half - life , the ADJ relationship must be used . ADJ NOUN is a ADJ use of naturally occurring NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its most famous application is NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can therefore learn about nuclear forces by VERB how ADV bound the nuclei are . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we define the binding energy ( be ) of a nucleus to be the energy required to completely VERB it into separate protons and neutrons . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we can determine the be of a nucleus from its rest mass . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> second , nuclear radiation depends on the NOUN and not on the chemical compound it is in , so that a ADJ NOUN can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the compound is said to be VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a ADJ compound used for medical purposes is called a NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> this is due to the body ’s ability to ADV VERB the damage . <sent_end> <sent_begin> any NOUN less than NUM PROPN ( NUM rem ) is called a low NOUN , NUM NOUN to NUM PROPN ( NUM to NUM rem ) is called a moderate NOUN , and PRON greater than NUM PROPN ( NUM rem ) is called a high NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> there is no known way to determine after the fact if a person has been exposed to less than NUM PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> to ADV limit radiation NOUN , we use NOUN , increase the distance from a source , and limit the time of exposure . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> nuclear fusion is a reaction in which NUM nuclei are combined , or VERB , to form a larger nucleus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> we know that all nuclei have less mass than the sum of the NOUN of the protons and neutrons that form them . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> break - even has nearly been reached and gives NOUN that NOUN and commercial plants may become a reality in a few decades . NUM techniques have shown considerable promise . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first of these is called magnetic NOUN and uses the property that charged particles have difficulty VERB magnetic field lines . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN , shown in [ link ] , has shown particular promise . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> being NOUN , even low - energy neutrons can strike a nucleus and be absorbed once they feel the ADJ nuclear force . <sent_end> <sent_begin> large nuclei are described by a liquid NOUN model with surface tension and NOUN NOUN , because the large number of NOUN act like atoms in a NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN is VERB and thus , deposits energy , causing the nucleus to VERB as a liquid NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the president may not be able to VERB key members of his or her administration without senate NOUN , but he or she can demand the NOUN or removal of NOUN officers , high - VERB NOUN ( such as NOUN ) , and members of the presidential NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during reconstruction , congress tried to VERB the president ’s removal power with the PROPN of office act ( NUM ) , which required senate NOUN to remove presidential NOUN who took office upon senate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> andrew johnson ’s NOUN of that legislation provided the NOUN for his impeachment in NUM . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> but the NOUN of civil service reform in the NUM ADV VERB presidents of that NOUN and reduced its NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although the president may call upon various agencies for assistance in lobbying for NOUN , such as the office of legislative PROPN with congress , it is often left to the chief executive to offer NOUN and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some of these are symbolic , like private NOUN in the white house or an appearance on the campaign NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the first NOUN of the first u.s. congress laid the framework for today ’s federal judicial system , established in the judiciary act of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although legislative changes over the years have VERB it , the basic structure of the judicial branch remains as it was set early on : at the lowest level are the district courts , where federal cases are tried , NOUN VERB , and evidence and NOUN are presented . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> but it took years for the court to get to that point , and it faced a number of NOUN on the way to such recognition . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in their first case of NOUN , PROPN v. georgia ( NUM ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of NUM state against a citizen of another state , and that article PROPN , section NUM , of the constitution did not protect the states from VERB such an interstate NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. georgia , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> the supreme court found itself in the middle of a NOUN between the ADJ presidential administration of john adams and that of ADJ president ( and opposition party member ) thomas jefferson . <sent_end> <sent_begin> it was an interesting NOUN at the time , particularly because jefferson and the man who would decide the case — john marshall — were themselves political NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> with each PROPN case it has decided , the supreme court has served as the NOUN , VERB the law and some of its provisions on NUM hand , but ruling some aspects of it unconstitutional on the other . <sent_end> <sent_begin> both supporters and opponents of the law have VERB victory and faced NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> societal NOUN , public opinion , and politics have often VERB in the way of the full expansion of rights and liberties to different groups , and not everyone has agreed that these rights should be expanded as they have been by the courts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> schools were long VERB by race until the court VERB NOUN in brown v. board of education ( NUM ) , and even then , many VERB in opposition and tried to block students at the NOUN to all - white schools . <sent_end> <sent_begin> brown v. board of education of PROPN , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> state courts really are the core of the u.s. judicial system , and they are responsible for a huge area of law . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most crimes and criminal activity , such as NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN , are NOUN of state laws , and cases are thus heard by state courts . <sent_end> <sent_begin> state courts also VERB civil matters ; personal NOUN , NOUN , NOUN , family , ADJ , NOUN , and contract NOUN and real NOUN cases , to name just a few , are usually state - level cases . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> from an individual ’s perspective , the ADJ court system has both benefits and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> on the plus side , each person has more than just NUM court system ADJ to protect his or her rights . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> today ’s federal court system was not an ADJ creation ; it has been changing and VERB for more than NUM NUM years through various acts of congress . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since district courts are not called for in article PROPN of the constitution , congress established them and ADV defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to VERB only cases that VERB within the district . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ADV , court NOUN can change as times and circumstances change — and as the courts themselves change when new NOUN are selected and take their place on the NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , the membership of the supreme court had changed entirely between PROPN v. ferguson ( NUM ) , which brought the doctrine of “ separate but equal ” and brown v. board of education ( NUM ) , which required integration . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. ferguson , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> the supreme court begins its annual NOUN on the first PROPN in october and ends late the following june . <sent_end> <sent_begin> every year , there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the supreme court , but the justices will select only a NOUN to be placed on the NOUN , which is the list of cases VERB on the court ’s NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> NOUN of the ADJ model recognize the NOUN between a bureaucracy like the internal revenue service ( PROPN ) and a private monopoly like a ADJ power company or internet service NOUN that has no NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such organizations are frequently VERB for waste , poor service , and a low level of NOUN NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they proposed the VERB NOUN process , often referred to as regulatory NOUN , or “ ADJ - ADJ ” for short . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this process was VERB in the PROPN PROPN acts of NUM and NUM , which encouraged agencies to VERB VERB NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> while VERB NOUN is required in only a NOUN of agencies and NOUN still use the traditional process , others have recognized the potential of the new process and have adopted it . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the debate over NUM particular ADJ response to the recession provides important NOUN into these NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the bureau in question is the consumer financial protection bureau ( PROPN ) , an agency created in NUM specifically to VERB certain financial industries that had VERB themselves to be especially ADJ to ADJ practices , such as ADJ - ADJ NOUN NOUN and NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to many in the republican party , this new bureau was ADV another instance of growing the federal bureaucracy to take care of problems caused by an ADJ government . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> under ADJ NOUN due to government NOUN and ADJ NOUN in the 1970s , government officials began looking for NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> when congress VERB the civil service reform act of NUM , it specifically included rights for federal NOUN , those who VERB NOUN committed within a bureaucracy or other organization , and set up protection from NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the act ’s PROPN systems protection board is a ADJ - ADJ institutional board VERB by NUM members appointed by the president and VERB by the senate that VERB NOUN , VERB NOUN into possible NOUN , and NOUN protections for NOUN who VERB out . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN , “ civil service reform , ” NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> over time , congress and the president have VERB these protections with additional acts . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on march NUM , NUM , both NOUN of congress passed the health care and education PROPN act ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN NUM — health care and education PROPN act of NUM , ” PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the story of the PROPN , which expanded and VERB some provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act ( PROPN ) , also known as PROPN , is a ADJ NOUN of NOUN politics in which the democratic party was able to VERB ADJ health care and higher education NOUN over ADJ republican opposition ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> some people VERB the PROPN as an example of getting things done in the face of ADJ NOUN in congress ; others see it a case of government power run ADV . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the president can also VERB or change policy through an executive order , which offers NOUN about how to VERB law under his or her NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> finally , policy changes can come as a result of court actions or NOUN , such as brown v. board of education of PROPN ( NUM ) , which ADV ended school segregation in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> brown v. board of education of PROPN , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> during the great depression of the 1930s , the united states created a set of policies and programs that VERB a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs , their homes , and their savings ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> under president franklin PROPN roosevelt , the federal government began programs like the work progress administration and PROPN conservation PROPN to combat unemployment and the home owners ’ loan corporation to VERB depression - related NOUN NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as the effects of the depression VERB , the government VERB out many of these programs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some people in the united states argue that the self - VERB and self - VERB NOUN provided by the existence of private goods mean that sound public policy requires very little government action . <sent_end> <sent_begin> known as NOUN , these individuals believe government almost always VERB less ADV than the private NOUN ( the segment of the economy run for profit and not under government control ) , and that government actions should therefore be VERB to a minimum . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by the beginning of the twentieth century , led by the PROPN , the united states had begun to search for ways to govern large businesses that had VERB to VERB market forces by VERB the supply of goods . <sent_end> <sent_begin> and , largely as a result of the great depression , people wanted ways of developing and protecting public goods that were ADJ and more ADJ than had existed before . <sent_end> <sent_begin> these forces and events led to the increased regulation of public and common goods , and a move for the public NOUN — the government — to take over of the provision of many NOUN goods . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , in NUM , senator PROPN johnson and representative PROPN PROPN , both republicans from california , won the day . <sent_end> <sent_begin> congress passed the PROPN PROPN project act , VERB the construction of NUM of the most ADJ NOUN NOUN in u.s. history . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the hoover PROPN ( [ link ] ) , completed in NUM , served the ADJ VERB of VERB ADJ power and VERB NUM NUM NOUN of land from the resulting NOUN ( lake PROPN ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the PROPN . new york : PROPN and PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this work and others like it helped to VERB the passage of the PROPN food and drug act ( NUM ) and ultimately led to the creation of government agencies such as the u.s. food and drug administration ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN / PROPN / PROPN / NOUN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the nation ’s experiences during the depression of NUM and the great depression of the 1930s also led to more ADJ regulatory policies designed to improve the NOUN of financial markets and prevent NOUN from forming . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> by the 1960s , social welfare had become a major function of the federal government — NUM to which most public policy funds are VERB — and had developed to serve several VERB functions . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first , social welfare policy is designed to ensure some level of NOUN in a democratic political system based on competitive , free - market economics . <sent_end> <sent_begin> during the great depression , many politicians came to fear that the high unemployment and low - income levels VERB society could VERB the stability of democracy , as was VERB in european countries like germany and PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> social security VERB these concerns with NUM important tools . <sent_end> <sent_begin> first and best known is the NOUN benefit . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> while social security was designed to provide cash payments to VERB the ADJ and ADJ , medicare and medicaid were intended to ensure that ADJ populations have access to health care . <sent_end> <sent_begin> medicare , like social security , is an NOUN program funded through payroll taxes . <sent_end> <sent_begin> its purpose is to make sure that senior citizens and NOUN have access to low - cost health care they might not otherwise have , because most u.s. citizens get their health insurance through their employers . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM of the reasons the news media are so ADJ is that citizens have a range of NOUN on public policy , and they are very interested in VERB how a given change would improve their lives or the country ’s . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but despite their interests , most people do little more than vote or ADV contribute to a political campaign . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a few people , however , become policy NOUN by actively working to VERB or maintain public policy . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> both the congress and the president have tried to reduce the bias in policy analysis by creating their own ADV ADJ policy branches . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in congress , the best known of these is the congressional budget office , or PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB in the NUM congressional budget and PROPN control act , the PROPN was ADV created in NUM as a way of increasing congress ’s independence from the executive branch . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> on a national level , policy implementation can be either top - down or bottom - up . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in top - down implementation , the federal government VERB the NOUN of the policy , and each state VERB it the same ADJ way . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in bottom - up implementation , the federal government allows local areas some NOUN to meet their specific challenges and needs . <sent_end> <sent_begin> daniel PROPN and paul PROPN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> finally , X - NOUN NOUN felt that keeping government out of the business of business would create an automatic cycle of economic growth and contraction . <sent_end> <sent_begin> contraction phases in which there is no economic growth for NUM ADJ NOUN , called NOUN , would bring business NOUN and higher unemployment . <sent_end> <sent_begin> but this condition , they believed , would correct itself on its own if the government simply allowed the system to operate . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the NOUN of PROPN to create a ADJ level of aggregate demand , VERB with a depression - era NOUN to promote social welfare policy , led the president and congress to develop a federal budget with spending divided into NUM broad categories : ADJ and ADJ ( see [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> of these , ADJ spending is the larger , consisting of about $ NUM NUM of the ADJ NUM budget , or roughly NUM percent of all federal expenditures . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ ADJ spending in NUM : an PROPN , ” NUM january NUM . ADV ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , the amount of money the u.s. government needed to borrow to pay its bills in NUM was still in excess of $ NUM NUM <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ the federal budget in NUM : an PROPN , ” NUM january NUM . DET ( march NUM , NUM ) . . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this was in addition to the country ’s almost $ NUM NUM of total debt — the amount of money the government VERB its NOUN — at the end of NUM , according to the department of the treasury . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this does not ADV mean the wealthy pay less than the poor , simply that the percentage of their income they pay in taxes will be lower . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consider , for example , the use of NOUN taxes on specific goods or services as a source of revenue . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ NOUN tax , ” PROPN ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> sometimes called “ NOUN taxes ” because they tend to be applied to goods like alcohol , NOUN , and gasoline , NOUN taxes have a ADJ quality , since the amount of the good VERB by the consumer , and thus the tax paid , does not increase at the same rate as income . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a person who makes $ NUM per year is likely to purchase more gasoline than a person who makes $ NUM per year ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> u.s. president PROPN obama and ADJ president PROPN PROPN VERB hands for the NOUN during the PROPN PROPN held june NUM – NUM , NUM , at PROPN PROPN in northern PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> " X <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a third main goal is the NOUN of a balance of power in the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a balance of power means no NUM nation or region is much more powerful ADV than are the countries of the rest of the world . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN of a perfect balance of power is probably not possible , but general stability , or NOUN in the operation of governments , strong institutions , and the absence of violence within and between nations may be . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the united nations ( PROPN ) is perhaps the ADJ international organization in the world today . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the main institutional bodies of the PROPN are the general PROPN and the security council . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> another cross - national organization to which the united states is VERB , and that exists to ADV represent western NOUN and in turn VERB the NOUN , is the north PROPN treaty organization ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN was formed after world war ii as the cold war between east and west started to VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at times the united states has been free trade – oriented , while at other times it has been ADJ . <sent_end> <sent_begin> perhaps its most free trade – oriented move was the NUM implementation of the north american free trade agreement ( PROPN ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN removed trade barriers and other NOUN costs VERB on goods moving between the united states , mexico , and canada . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> had they not VERB , an VERB set of NOUN likely would have included ADJ sanctions ( removal of NOUN ) , economic sanctions ( such as an NOUN on trade and the flow of money between the countries ) , minor military NOUN ( such as establishment of a no - NOUN zone just outside chinese NOUN ) , or more significant military NOUN ( such as a focused campaign to enter china and get the NOUN back ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ tools to influence another country , like economic sanctions , are referred to as soft power , while the use of military power is termed hard power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN , PROPN NUM . soft power : the means to success in world politics . washington , dc : public affairs . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> president george PROPN w. bush VERB u.s. troops VERB in PROPN PROPN on PROPN day in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first troops were VERB there in august NUM , as part of operation PROPN PROPN , which was intended to build u.s. military strength in the area in NOUN for an ADJ military operation . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> even when their climate and land are well - VERB to products like cotton , NOUN , sugar , or NOUN , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to VERB . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NOUN NOUN in the high - income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this increase in supply NOUN down world prices of NOUN products below the costs of production . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM concern is that while globalization may be VERB high - skilled , high - wage workers in the united states , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after all , high - skilled u.s. workers ADV benefit from increased sales of ADJ products like NOUN , NOUN , and NOUN in which the united states has a comparative advantage . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> however , ADJ politicians , business leaders , and workers VERB that if the local industry had a chance to get established , before it needed to face international competition , then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills , management , technology , and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit - earning domestic industry . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the NOUN industry argument for NOUN is to block imports for a limited time , to give the NOUN industry time to mature , before it VERB competing on equal terms in the global economy . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ( VERB macroeconomic policy around the world for more information on the NOUN industry argument . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> anti - ADJ laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by VERB tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since NOUN is not allowed under the rules of the world trade organization ( PROPN ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of VERB goods can VERB a NOUN with the PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> anti - ADJ NOUN have VERB in recent years , from about NUM cases per year in the late 1980s to about NUM new cases each year by the late NOUN . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in general , high - income countries such as the united states , canada , PROPN , and the nations of the european union have relatively strict environmental standards . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast , NOUN and low - income countries like brazil , PROPN , PROPN , and china have lower environmental standards . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a NOUN : as soon as their people have enough to eat , ADJ healthcare , and longer life NOUN , then they will spend more money on NOUN treatment plants , NOUN to reduce air pollution from factory NOUN , national NOUN to protect NOUN , and so on . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the world trade organization ( PROPN ) was ADV born in NUM , but its history is much longer . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the years after the great depression and world war ii , there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would VERB the nations of the world together . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the best known of these ADJ trading agreements is the european union . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in the years after world war ii , leaders of several european nations VERB that if they could VERB their economies together more closely , they might be more likely to avoid another ADJ war . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in other words , the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not ADJ or does not VERB NOUN ; indeed , the story of PROPN begins with a particular ADJ market change — a new technology — that causes real NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in thinking about the NOUN of foreign trade , or any of the other possible costs and NOUN of foreign trade discussed in this chapter , the best public policy NOUN typically do not involve NOUN , but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues , while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the m term in the equation for the line is the slope . <sent_end> <sent_begin> remember that slope is defined as rise over run ; more specifically , the slope of a line from NUM point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in this example , each time the x term increases by NUM ( the run ) , the y term rises by NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> NUM common line graph is called a time series , in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis VERB another variable . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> economists use a NOUN of VERB utility to describe people ’s NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in consumer choices , the level of utility that a person receives is described in ADJ terms . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this NOUN VERB an alternative approach to describing personal NOUN , called indifference curves , which VERB any need for using numbers to measure utility . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , the marginal utility that PROPN would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from NUM to NUM must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of NOUN was cut from NUM to NUM — so that her overall utility remains ADJ between points a and b . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of NOUN , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade NUM good for another so that utility will remain the same . <sent_end> <sent_begin> indifference curves like INTJ are ADJ on the left and ADJ on the right . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> a rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in ADJ terms , the new budget constraint will now be ADJ to a higher indifference curve , representing a higher level of utility . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left , which will cause it to be ADJ to a lower indifference curve , representing a reduced level of utility . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the price of NOUN rises to $ NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN VERB at choice a on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> after the price of NOUN increases , he VERB b on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the concept of a present VERB value ( PROPN ) , which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a NOUN of expected future payments , can be used to calculate appropriate prices for NOUN and bonds . <sent_end> <sent_begin> to place a present VERB value on a future payment , think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the keynesian cross diagram contains NUM lines that serve as ADJ NOUN to VERB the discussion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first is a vertical line showing the level of potential gdp . <sent_end> <sent_begin> potential gdp means the same NOUN here that it means in the ad / as NOUN : it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital . the second ADJ line on the keynesian cross diagram is the ADJ line , which VERB at the origin and VERB up and to the right . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> [ link ] shows an investment function where the level of investment is , for the NOUN of NOUN , set at the specific level of NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real gdp ( or national income ) , the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real gdp . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> imports are NUM of real gdp in this example , and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the final NOUN , aggregate expenditures , VERB up c + i + g + x – m . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in [ link ] . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in this situation , the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for gdp to reach its full employment level , and unemployment will occur . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the distance between an output level like NOUN that is below potential gdp and the level of potential gdp is called a ADJ gap . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because the equilibrium level of real gdp is so low , firms will not VERB to hire the full employment number of workers , and unemployment will be high . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of NUM party without VERB a cost on another . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> remember , the demand curve VERB consumers ’ NOUN to pay for different quantities . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the amount that individuals would have been willing to pay , minus the amount that they actually paid , is called consumer surplus . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consumer surplus is the area labeled f — that is , the area above the market price and below the demand curve . <sent_end> <sent_begin> consumer and producer surplus the somewhat ADJ area labeled by f shows the area of consumer surplus , which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> first , an ADJ outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an ADJ quantity is called ADJ loss . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a very real sense , it is like money VERB away that benefits no one . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the demand and supply model VERB that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply , but by the interaction between the NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , the famous economist PROPN marshall wrote that VERB whether supply or demand determined a price was like VERB “ whether it is the upper or the under NOUN of a pair of NOUN that cuts a piece of paper . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> the answer is that both NOUN of the demand and supply NOUN are always involved . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at this time , the idea of liberty became an important concept . <sent_end> <sent_begin> according to john PROPN , an english political NOUN of the ADJ century , all people have natural rights to life , liberty , and property . <sent_end> <sent_begin> from this came the idea that people should be free to VERB to being VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in ADJ countries , the government also usually VERB and controls NOUN such as NOUN , transportation systems like NOUN and NOUN , and NOUN systems . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in many ADJ countries the government is an NOUN : only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , in china , the government is run by members of the chinese communist party . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> thus , u.s. citizens vote for members of congress , the president and vice president , members of state legislatures , governors , NOUN , and members of town NOUN and school NOUN to act on their behalf . <sent_end> <sent_begin> most representative governments favor majority rule : the NOUN of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority . <sent_end> <sent_begin> if the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who VERB it , the law will be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the other end of the political spectrum are elite - driven forms of government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in a NOUN , NUM NOUN , usually a ADJ NOUN , holds political power . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although the power of some NOUN is limited by law , and such NOUN and NOUN often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country , this is not always the case . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> this belief is called the elite theory of government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in contrast to that perspective is the ADJ theory of government , which says that political power VERB with competing interest groups who share influence in government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> ADJ theorists VERB that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> rather than VERB in the hands of individuals , a variety of organized groups hold power , with some groups having more influence on certain issues than others . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thousands of interest groups exist in the united states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> “ the non - governmental order : will PROPN PROPN , or ADV VERB , global PROPN ? ” the economist , NUM december NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> approximately NUM percent of americans report VERB to at least NUM group . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ronald PROPN PROPN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of the NOUN made by government are about freedom of speech . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first amendment of the constitution gives americans the right to express their NOUN on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not VERB with this right . <sent_end> <sent_begin> because of the fourteenth amendment , state governments must protect this right also . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> are fewer people today active in politics than in the past ? <sent_end> <sent_begin> political scientist robert PROPN has argued that ADJ NOUN is VERB ; although many americans may report VERB to groups , these groups are usually large , ADJ ones with thousands of members . <sent_end> <sent_begin> people who join groups such as PROPN international or PROPN may share certain values and NOUN with other members of the group , but they do not actually interact with these other members . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> they argued that it was ADJ to VERB NUM - year - NOUN the right to vote for the people who had the power to VERB them to war . <sent_end> <sent_begin> as a result , the twenty - PROPN amendment , which VERB the voting age in national elections to NUM , was ratified by the states and went into effect in NUM . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> some people prefer even more active and direct forms of NOUN such as protest NOUN and NOUN , including civil NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> such NOUN were used successfully in the african american civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the beliefs and attitudes that led to the call for independence had long been an important part of colonial life . <sent_end> <sent_begin> of all the political NOUN who influenced american beliefs about government , the most important is ADV john PROPN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the most significant contributions of PROPN , a ADJ - century english NOUN , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be god - given rights to life , liberty , and property . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> so committed were the british to the protection of these natural rights that when the NOUN PROPN NOUN began to VERB upon them in the ADJ century , PROPN removed king james ii , already VERB because he was PROPN PROPN , in the PROPN revolution and VERB his ADJ daughter and her NOUN to rule the nation . <sent_end> <sent_begin> before VERB the NOUN to william and PROPN , however , PROPN passed the english bill of rights in NUM . <sent_end> <sent_begin> a bill of rights is a list of the liberties and protections VERB by a nation ’s citizens . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the first such tax to draw the NOUN of colonists was the stamp act , passed in NUM , which required that almost all paper goods , such as NOUN , land NOUN , NOUN , and newspapers , have revenue NOUN placed on them . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the NOUN was so great that the new tax was quickly VERB , but its NOUN was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the PROPN acts ( NUM ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and NOUN . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the bill of rights was intended to VERB the NOUN of anti - federalists that the constitution did not ADV protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government . <sent_end> <sent_begin> many of these first NUM amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> for example , the right to bear arms for protection ( second amendment ) , the right not to have to provide NOUN and provision for soldiers in NOUN ( third amendment ) , the right to a trial by NOUN ( PROPN and PROPN amendments ) , and protection from excessive NOUN and from ADJ and unusual punishment ( PROPN amendment ) are taken from the english bill of rights . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the fifth amendment , which requires among other things that people can not be VERB of their life , liberty , or property except by a legal NOUN , was also greatly influenced by english law as well as the protections granted to PROPN in the virginia declaration of rights . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the ADJ and PROPN amendments were intended to provide yet another NOUN that people ’s rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the PROPN amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the VERB documents . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this was an important NOUN that the protected rights were extensive , and the government should not attempt to VERB with them . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> the main advantage of this NOUN requirement is that no changes to the constitution can occur unless there is broad support within congress and among states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the potential NOUN is that numerous national amendment NOUN — such as the equal rights amendment ( era ) , which VERB to VERB equal rights regardless of sex — have VERB because they can not VERB sufficient NOUN among members of congress or , in the case of the era , the states . <sent_end>

<sent_begin> particularly in times of war , or even in response to NOUN against national security , the government has held VERB NOUN NOUN without access to ADJ courts , often without access to NOUN or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military NOUN or VERB them ADV without trial . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for example , during the civil war , president abraham lincoln VERB VERB confederate NOUN and NOUN in union - controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts , leading the supreme court to rule in PROPN PROPN PROPN that the government could not VERB the ADJ court system in states where it was operating . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN PROPN PROPN , NUM u.s.

<sent_begin> NUM , argued that the constitution was “ ADV intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> hamilton went on to argue that VERB some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a NOUN for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected . <sent_end> <sent_begin> later , james madison , in his speech VERB the proposed amendments that would become the bill of rights , VERB another federalist argument : “ it has been said , that a bill of rights is not necessary , because the establishment of this government has not VERB those NOUN of rights which are added to the several state NOUN . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> american history from revolution to reconstruction and beyond , “ madison speech VERB the bill of rights june NUM NUM , ” PROPN / PROPN / PROPN - NUM / madison - speech - VERB - the - bill - of - rights - NOUN - NUM ( march NUM , NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> for that matter , the articles of confederation had not included a specific NOUN of rights either . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> ultimately , james madison delivered on this promise by VERB a NOUN of amendments in the first congress , VERB from the declaration of rights in the virginia state constitution , NOUN from the ratification NOUN , and other sources , which were ADV VERB in both houses of congress and ultimately proposed as NUM separate amendments for ratification by the states . <sent_end> <sent_begin> NUM of the amendments were successfully ratified by the ADJ NUM percent of the states and became known as the bill of rights ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the wake of the civil war , however , the VERB thinking about the application of the bill of rights to the states changed . <sent_end> <sent_begin> soon after slavery was VERB by the PROPN amendment , state governments — particularly those in the former PROPN — began to pass “ black NOUN ” that restricted the rights of former slaves and effectively VERB them to second - class NOUN under their state laws and NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> VERB by these actions , members of the radical republican NOUN in congress demanded that the laws be VERB . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> legal scholars and the courts have ADV VERB the meaning of this NOUN or NOUN clause over the years ; some have argued that it was VERB to extend the entire bill of rights ( or at least the first NUM amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in NUM , justice john paul PROPN , writing for a majority of the supreme court , argued in PROPN v. roe that the clause protects the right to travel from NUM state to another . <sent_end> <sent_begin> PROPN v. roe , NUM u.s.

NUM ( NUM ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the second provision of the fourteenth amendment that VERB to VERB the bill of rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any state VERB any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ” <sent_end> <sent_begin> this provision is similar to the fifth amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and ADV by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as ADJ due process ) . <sent_end> <sent_begin> although the NOUN of the provision does not VERB rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> we can ADV divide the provisions of the bill of rights into NUM categories . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the first , second , third , and fourth amendments protect basic individual freedoms ; the fourth ( ADV ) , fifth , PROPN , ADJ , and PROPN protect people VERB or VERB of criminal activity ; and the ADJ and PROPN , are consistent with the NOUN ’ view that the bill of rights is not necessarily an ADJ list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> at the same time , public NOUN was beginning to take root on a wide scale . <sent_end> <sent_begin> since most states had traditional ADJ NOUN and most state officials were PROPN themselves , the public school NOUN VERB many ADJ features ; at times , these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other christian NOUN or from other religious NOUN . <sent_end> <sent_begin> the establishment clause today tends to be VERB a NOUN more ADV than in the past ; it not only VERB the creation of a “ church of the united states ” or “ church of PROPN ” it also VERB the government from VERB NUM set of religious beliefs over others or VERB religion ( of any variety ) over non - religion . <sent_end> <sent_begin> thus , the government can not promote , say , ADJ beliefs over PROPN beliefs or belief in god over NOUN or NOUN ( [ link ] ) . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> the free exercise clause , on the other hand , limits the ability of the government to control or VERB religious practices . <sent_end> <sent_begin> this portion of the first amendment VERB not the government ’s NOUN of religion , but rather government NOUN of religious beliefs and practices . <sent_end>
<sent_begin> in the 1960s and 1970s , the court decided NUM cases in which it laid out a general test for VERB similar cases in the future . <sent_end> <sent_begin> in both PROPN v. PROPN , a case VERB with unemployment NOUN , and PROPN v.
